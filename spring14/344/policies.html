      <h3><a name="email">Email</a></h3>

      <p> Email contact with the course instructor is a necessity in this 
class..  I will check email several times throughout the work day, and will 
also check email once per evening to answer questions and resolve issues.  
Email contact over the weekend may be more sporadic, although I will be 
sure to check at least once.

    <li> <h3><A name="computercell">Computer and Cell Phone Policy</a></h3>

    <p> Computers will be an integral part of this course, both inside and
      outside of class.  However, out of courtesy to both the instructor and
      other students, please do not use the lab computers for non-class
      related activity.  In particular, you do not need to be using a computer
      unless an exercise or in class activity requiring them is in progress.
      </p>

    <p> You are unlikely to need cell phones during the course of lecture.  
Please ensure that your cell phone is set to vibrate or silent during 
lecture, and do not send text messages of any kind.  </p>

      <li> Homework and Programming Assignments (50%)

	<p> There will be a series of written homeworks, essay assignments 
in the class, and programming assignments which (in total) will compromise 
50% of your final score.  Essays will be over papers assigned in class.  
Each will be at most 300 words long, and should both summarize key points 
and take an opinion on the article.

      </li>
    
     <li> Quizzes or in class work (5%)
     
     <p>A total of 5% of your final grade is reserved for in class exercises and quizzes, at the instructor's discretion.

	<li> Exams (45%)

	<p> There will be a midterm worth 15% of your total grade, and a 
final exam worth 30% of your total grade.  The midterm will be the week 
before spring break (unless we have any major schedule changes).

      <P>
      Letter grades will be based on each students overall

	    Student percentage above 93% will result in a grade of

      </DL>Any modification to this scale at the end of the year
      will be <EM>in favor of the students</EM>. That is we may
      later decide to award an A to a student who is slightly
      below the above cutoff, but we certainly will not deny
      an A from someone who is above the cutoff.
  </LI>


  <li> <h3><a name="latehomework">Late Homework</a></h3>

	<p> Homeworks will generally be due at 11:59pm via email.  Late 
submissions will be penalizes 10% for each hour they are late.  Please 
contact me as early as possible with any potential issues, since I am much 
more likely to grant an extension (for valid conflicts) if I am notified 
early.

  </li>

  <li> <h3><a name="regrades">Regrade Requests</a></h3>

	<p> I am happy to regrade any assignments, programs, quizzes or exam problems which you 
think were unfair or incorrect.  Please bring me the original assignment, plus a written 
explanation of your question or complaint, within <em>two weeks</em> of the time the paper in 
question is graded and returned to you.

  </li>

  <li> <H3><A name="academicintegrity">Academic Integrity</A></H3>

<p> In the context of this course, I encourage students to discuss general course material, which
includes studying for exams, sharing notes if a student must miss class, and working on any practice
problems which are assigned.  We will also have occasional programming assignments that will be 
completed in pairs.  However, unless clearly stated otherwise in the assignment description, 
any work which will be submitted for a grade must
be completed by individuals.  In addition, the  <b> only </b> acceptable sources of information
are the course textbook, the instructor, official university tutors, or other sources which are 
explicitly mentioned in an assignment.  Students may <b>not</b> use other sources, including
(but not limited to) websites other than the official course website or those explicitly listed
in course materials, textbooks other than those officially listed below, or
students (either past or present). </p>

<p> Students who violate academic integrity policies will be reported to the 
department.  First time offenses on homework will result in a minimum of a failing 
grade on the assignment in question, with egregious or repeated offenses resulting in 
failure in the course.  In addition, students may be referred to the College of Arts 
and Sciences for further disciplinary action.

    <p>The following is a statement of minimum standards for student academic integrity 
at Saint Louis University; I expect full compliance with the policies described.</p>

<p>The University is a community of learning, whose effectiveness requires an 
environment of mutual trust and integrity, such as would be expected at a Jesuit, 
Catholic institution. As members of this community, students, faculty, and staff 
members share the responsibility to maintain this environment. Academic dishonesty 
violates it. Although not all forms of academic dishonesty can be listed here, it can 
be said in general that soliciting, receiving, or providing any unauthorized assistance 
in the completion of any work submitted toward academic credit is dishonest. It not 
only violates the mutual trust necessary between faculty and students, but also 
undermines the validity of the University's evaluation of students and takes unfair 
advantage of fellow students.</p>

<p>Further, it is the responsibility of any student who observes such dishonest conduct 
to call it to the attention of a faculty member or administrator.</p>

<p>Examples of academic dishonesty would be copying from another student, copying from 
a book or class notes during a closed-book exam, submitting materials authored by or 
editorially revised by another person but presented as the student's own work, 
copying a passage or text directly from a published source without appropriately citing 
or recognizing that source, taking a test or doing an assignment or other academic work 
for another student, tampering with another student's work, securing or supplying in 
advance a copy of an examination without the knowledge or consent of the instructor, 
and colluding with another student or students to engage in an act of academic 
dishonesty.</p>

<p>Where there is clear indication of such dishonesty, a faculty member or 
administrator has the responsibility to apply appropriate sanctions. Investigations of 
violations will be conducted in accord with standards and procedures of the school or 
college through which the course or research is offered. Recommendations of sanctions 
to be imposed will be made to the dean of the school or college in which the student is 
enrolled. Possible sanctions for a violation of academic integrity include, but are not 
limited to, disciplinary probation, suspension, and dismissal from the University. </p>

    <li> <h3><a name="disabilities">Students with Disabilities or Special 
Needs</a></h3> In recognition that people learn in a variety of ways and that learning 
is influenced by multiple factors (e.g., prior experience, study skills, learning 
disability), resources to support student success are available on campus. Students who 
think they might benefit from these resources can find out more about:
<ul>
<li>Course-level support (e.g., faculty member, departmental resources, etc.) by asking 
your course instructor. 
<li>University-level support (e.g., tutoring/writing services, 
Disability Services) by visiting the Student Success Center (BSC 331) or by going to 
www.slu.edu/success. 
</ul>
Students who believe that, due to a disability, they could benefit 
from academic accommodations are encouraged to contact Disability Services at 
314-977-8885 or to visit the Student Success Center. Confidentiality will be observed 
in all inquiries. Course instructors support student accommodation requests when an 
approved letter from Disability Services has been received and when students discuss 
these accommodations with the instructor after receipt of the approved letter.

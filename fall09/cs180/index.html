<li><p> Dec. 3: <a href="finalreview.pdf">Here</a> is a set of problems 
covering topics since the last midterm that were NOT covered on homeworks.  
(Note: This is about equivalent to an extra homework over these topics, but 
these problems will not be graded; they are merely provided to help you 
study for the final exam, so that you know what type of problems to 
expect.)    

<li><p>  Dec. 1: Tomorrow at the end of class I'll be handing out 
teacher evaluations for the semester; please try to attend if possible!

<li><p>Nov. 29: <a href="programming/program6.html">Program 6</a> is 
available; it will be due Monday, Dec. 7, by 11:59pm.  Note that there will be in class checkpoint on this Thursday!

<li><p>Oct. 27: <a href="ListClass.h">Here</a> is a copy of the .h file

<li><p>Oct. 8: Since I've been sick and unable to answer questions promptly for the last couple of days, I'm extending the due date for programming assignment 2 for 24 more hours.  It will be due Friday at 11:59pm instead of tonight.  I hope this helps those of you who haven't been able to get prompt feedback from me (although you are still free to submit the assignment today if you prefer).

<li><p>Oct. 8: There will be class today.

<li><p>Oct. 6: I'm still sick, so tomorrow - Wednesday, Oct. 7 - will be 
your lab for this week (instead of the usual Thursday lab).  Dr. Scannell will be there to help with any questions you might have.  Hopefully I'll be well enough to come back in Thursday; keep checking here for updates.

<li><p>Oct. 5: Since I won't be in today, please email me your 30 lines of 
code (pasted into the body of an email) along with any questions or comments 
you might have.   

<li><p>Oct. 5: There will be no class today (Monday), since I am quite sick 
with the flu.  Please read the section of your textbook on deques; we will 
cover the material briefly in class, but I will expect everyone to be 
familiar with them from the reading.   Sorry for the lateness of this 
announcement!

<li><p>Oct 1: There will be class tomorrow (Friday), at the usual time and 
place.

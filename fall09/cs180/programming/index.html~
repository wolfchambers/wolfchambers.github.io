      <H2>Programming Assignments</H2>

We expect to have 6-8 programming assignments during this course.
Your lowest score will be dropped at the end of the
course and your remaining scores will be averaged.
<p>
Please make sure you understand the policy towards <a href="../#integrity">Academic Integrity</a>.
<p>
Programming assignments are due via email to the instructor by 11:59pm on the 
date specified.  Please be sure to email all relevant .cpp files, as well as a makefile if it is needed.  In addition, I will require submission of a readme, which should contain a description of your design choice, as well as any special instructions and a list of the people who worked on the project.
<p> 
Late submissions will be penalized in accordance with our <a
href="../#late">Late Policy</a>.   
<p>
The table below gives the assignments, and associated dates.  All
future dates/topics are tentative until such assignments are made available.

<h4><a name="submit"><b>What to submit</b></a></h4>


<UL>
  <Li>
      <a name="source">Source Code</a>
      <p>
      For each assignment, you must submit all <u>source code files</u> that you
      have created or modified.
      For many assignments, we will have provided you with a number of files
      containing source code that need not be modified.  In such cases,
      there is no need for you to re-submit these files; we have them
      already. 
      </p>
  </LI>

  <LI>
      <a name="readme">"readme" File</a>

      <P>
      You are required to submit a text file titled "readme" with
      every program you submit.  Please do not submit any formatted
      files such as those produced by Microsoft Word or other word
      processors.  It will be read at the time your program is graded,
      so it allows you to give helpful information. 
      </P>

      <P>
      The content of the file should generally include
      <UL>
	<LI>
	    <P>
	    Your name
	    </P>
	</LI>
	    
	<LI>
	    <P>
	    A brief (i.e. one or two paragraph) overview of your program and
	    any interesting design decisions that you made.
	    </P>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	    <P>
	    A clear citation of any help you received on this program from
	    other (approved!) sources, as detailed in the policy on
	    <A href="../#integrity">Academic Integrity</A>.
	    </P>
	</LI>

	<LI>
	    <P>
	    Many of our program assignments
	    explicitly require the inclusion of additional,
	    specific information in this file.  <b>Please read
	    the individual program assignments carefully.</b>
	    </P>
	</LI>
	<LI>
	    <P>
	    Finally, you may include any other discussion that you feel
	    will be helpful when grading your assignment.  For example, if there
	    are known bugs or problems with your program, you might briefly
	    discuss them here.
	    </P>
	</LI>
      </UL>
      </P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
      <a name="input">Test Input</a>

      <P>
      For some of the programming assignments, you will be asked to submit
      an additional file "inputfile" that provides test input for the
      program.  In these cases, we will run all of the students' programs on
      all of the students' test inputs.  Your goal will be to have your test
      input fool as many students as possible while having your program work
      correctly on as many of the other test inputs as possible. 
      </P>
      <P>
      In such cases, please make sure that your input files conform strictly
      to the expected format standards when the program driver is run using
      your file as input.  Again, such input files must be submitted as a
      plain unformatted text file (for instance one created with "Notepad"
      on a Windows system).  Do not submit any formatted files such as those
      produced by Microsoft Word or other word processors.
      </P>
  </LI>
</UL>


<h4><a name="electronic">Electronic Submission Procedure</h4>

All programming assignments must be submitted electronically via email to the instructor.  You may attach the relevant files, or (preferably) zip or tar them into a single file to simplify the process.


<h4><a name="grades">Receiving Grade Reports</a></h4>
Grade reports for each program will be emailed to the students as grade reports are finished.

<H1><A NAME="overview">Overview</A></H1>

<P>
Chapter&nbsp;1.6 of the text introduces an example of a credit card
class.  We will use that class as a model for that assignment, but we
are making some adaptions and adding additional functionality.  In
particular, we will introduce bookkeeping for a typical monthly cycle.


<HR>


<H1><A NAME="specs">Specifications</A></H1>

<P>
Meeting formal specifications is a vital aspect of programming.
The public interface for a class serves as a contract for coordination
between the implementor of the class (in this case, you)  and the
users of that class (in this case, you and the rest of the class).
As part of this assignment, we are providing a header file,
<tt>CreditCard.h</tt>, which defines the public interface for the
<tt>CreditCard</tt> class.   This includes signatures for the required
<b>public</b> member functions. <b>Formal documentation has been embedded
in the source code and is <a
href="http://mathcs.slu.edu/~goldwasser/courses/slu/csci180/2009_Spring/programs/prog01/doxygen/class_credit_card.html">viewable here</a></b>.
Please make sure that you carefully
read and follow the specifications outlined in this section when
designing your program. If you feel that there are any ambiguities,
ask for clarification <em>before</em> completing the assignment.


<P>
A <tt>CreditCard</tt> instance manages aspects of a typical credit
card account.   Some of the functionality is rather basic, for example
keeping track of the owner's name, the card number, the credit limit.
There must also be basic support for managing the up-to-the-minute
balance on the account, including allowing for the customer to make
charges against the card (though not exceeding the limit) and making
payments to pay off some portion of the current balance.


<P>
The most challenging aspect of our specification is that your class
must also manage the typical monthly cycle for a credit card.  A
customer can stay in good grace each month by paying the full
balance as it existed at the time of the most recent formal statement.
(even if new charges this month means that the current balance is
non-zero).    A good customer is never charged 
interest or fees.    However, additional charges are accrued when that
previous balance is not paid off.  In particular, once a customer
loses good graces, interest is charged on the entire current balance
(old charges and new charges).   Furthermore, if the customer did not
even meet the minimum payment schedule established by the company, an
additional late fee is assessed.

<p>
More formally, a <tt>processMonth</tt> method will be triggered
at the end of each hypothetical month.  The responsibility of that
method is to calculate appropriate interest and fees and to
recalculate a minimum payment for the coming month.  The 
formal rules  are as follows.
<UL>
  <LI>
      <P>
      The process is based upon the balance and minimum payment that
      had been recorded at the conclusion of the most recent call to
      <tt>processMonth</tt> (these figures are assumed to be $0 if this is the
      customer's first month with the card). The updated balance and 
      minimum payment should be computed as follows: 
      <OL>
	<LI>
	    <P>
	    If payments received this month did not meet or exceed
	    the <em>balance on record at the conclusion of the most recent
	    call to <tt>processMonth</tt></em>, an interest charge
	    of <NOBR>(current balance)*(monthly interest rate)</NOBR>
	    should be added to the current balance (rounded to the
	    nearest cent).
	</LI>

	<LI>
	    <P>
	    If payments received this month do not meet or exceed the
	    <em>minimum monthly payment on record at the conclusion of
	    the most recent call to <tt>processMonth</tt></em>,
            an additional late charge of $20 should be added to the balance.
	</LI>

      	<LI>
	    <P>
	    This updated balance becomes the current balance, but is
	    also recorded as the offical "statement" balance,
	    for future reference.
	</LI>

	<LI>
	    <P>
	    If the new balance is non-zero, a minimum monthly payment
	    should be calculated and recorded.   Generally, the
	    minimum payment will be the larger of $30 or 5% of the
	    new balance (rounded to the nearest dollar).  However, we
	    cannot demand a minimum payment that is greater than the
	    balance.  If the above calculation were greater than the
	    current balance, the minimum payment should be set to the
	    full balance (unless, of course, the current balance is
	    negative, in which case a minimum payment of $0 should be
	    assigned).
	</LI>
      </OL>
  </LI>
</UL>


<p>
The official set of <b>public</b> methods which must be supported is as follows:

<h4>The constructor</h4>

<p>
The constructor has the following signature
<UL>
  <LI>
      <P>
      <B><TT>CreditCard(string no, string nm, int lim, double rate, int bal=0)</TT></B>
  </LI>
</UL>
Note well that we have varied slightly from the convention of the
text's version.   The parameter <tt>lim</tt> defines the credit limit
for the card (expressed in dollars).   The parameter <tt>bal</tt>
defines the initial balance on the account <b>(expressed in cents)</b>.
We provide a default initial balance of 0, as a new account typically
starts with a zero balance.  However, we leave open the possibility
that someone may open a new credit card while transferring a non-zero
balance from elsewhere. 

<p>
Although your class may have other private attributes in addition to
those listed as parameters, all others attributes should have initial
values that are not directly customizable. For example, the minimum
required payment for the first month of a new card is automatically
zero (even with a non-zero starting balance).



<h4>Accessors</h4>
<p>
There are seven standard accessor functions to return the values of
respective aspects of the underlying state.  Those signatures are:

<UL>
  <LI>
      <p>
      <B><TT>string getNumber() const</TT></B>
      <br>
      Though we talk about the 16-digit "credit card number", we
      represent this as a string, because it is too large to represent
      numerically.
  </LI>
  <LI>
      <p>
      <B><TT>string getName() const</TT></B>
      <br>
      Customer's name.
  </LI>
  <LI>
      <p>
      <B><TT>int getLimit() const</TT></B>
      <br>
      Reports the card's credit limit (expressed in dollars).
      Note, however, that interest charges may actually cause
      a balance to rise above this limit.
  </LI>
  <LI>
      <p>
      <B><TT>double getRate() const</TT></B>
      <br>
      Montly interest rate.  Represented as a floating-point number
      rather than as a percentage.  (e.g., an interest rate of .01
      represents 1% per month)
  </LI>
  <LI>
      <p>
      <B><TT>int getCurrentBalance() const</TT></B>
      <br>
      This reports the up-to-the-minute balance on the account
      (measured in cents).
  </LI>
  <LI>
      <p>
      <B><TT>int getStatementBalance() const</TT></B>
      <br>
      This reports the balance (measured in cents) that had been recorded at the
      conclusion of the most recent call to <tt>processMonth</tt>
      This is significant, as it affects the rules for interest
      charges and late fees.
  </LI>
  <LI>
      <p>
      <B><TT>int getMinPayment() const</TT></B>
      <br>
      This should be the minimum payment (measured in cents) that was
      recorded at the 
      conclusion of the most recent call to <tt>processMonth</tt>
      This is significant to the customer when making payments to
      avoid subsequent late fees.
  </LI>
</UL>

<h4>Mutators</h4>

<UL>
  <LI>
      <P>
      <B><TT>bool chargeIt(int price)</TT></B>
      <BR>
      This is called when the card owner attempts to make a purchase
      for the given price (measured in cents).  The charge should only be approved if the
      resulting balance were to remain at or below the user's credit
      limit.  The return value should be <tt>true</tt> if the charge
      is being accepted and <tt>false</tt> if rejected.
      <P>
      <em>You should refuse charges for a negative amount.</em>
  </LI>

  <LI>
      <P>
      <B><TT>void makePayment(int payment)</TT></B>
      <BR>
      This is called when the card owner submits the specified
      payment (measured in cents).
      <em>Negative payments should be ignored.</em>
      Assuming the payment is positive, the customer's current
      balance should be reduced to reflect the payment.
  </LI>

  <LI>
      <P>
      <B><TT>int processMonth()</TT></B>
      <BR>
      This is the method which is responsible for the end-of-month
      bookkeeping, as explained in detail above.   The updated balance
      and new minimum payment should be recorded internally for future
      reference.   In addition, the new minimum payment should be
      returned to the caller (measured in cents).
  </LI>

</UL>



<p>
<b>Note Well:</b>
None of your methods should generate any output.   We have provided an
implementation already for the output stream operator (&lt;&lt;) and
the user of a credit card can print their own information based on
values returned by the standard accessors.




<hr>

<H1><A NAME="example">An example</A></H1>

<p>
As an example, assume a new card is created with zero balance and
0.79% monthly interest (approximately 9.5% per year).
During the first month, charges of $325.75, $800 and $100 are made to the card.
When <tt>processMonth()</tt> is called, no late charge or interest charge
should be incurred, because there was no minimum payment or balance as
of the beginning of the month.  However at this time, the current
balance of $1225.75 and a minimum payment of $61 is recorded.


<P>
Continuing, lets assume that the next month includes new charges
totaling $228, and payments totaling $300.   If <tt>processMonth()</tt>
is again called, the processing should be handled as follows.   The
received payments of $300 surpass the minimum monthly requirement of
$61, so no late charge is assessed.  However, the $300 does not
constitute payment in full against the previous monthly balance of
$1225.75.  Therefore interest will be computed based on the <u>current</u>
balance which is <NOBR>$1153.75 ($1125.75 + $228 - $300)</NOBR>.  At the specified
rate, an interest charge of $9.11 is added to the balance, resulting
in an end of the month balance of $1162.86, and an associated minimum
monthly payment of $58.


<P>
In the third month, assume that there is no activity on the card.
Because there is an unpaid balance of $1162.86, an interest charge of
$9.19 is added to the balance.   Worse yet, because not even the
minimum payment from the previous statement was paid, a late charge of
$20 is added to the balance.   Therefore the new balance is $1192.05.
The minimum payment assigned for the subsequent month is $60.

<p>
In the fourth month, the customer makes a payment of $1200 and an
additional purchase of $500.  In this case, at the end of the month,
no late fees or interest are charged, because the payment of $1200
exceeds the previous month's balance of $1192.05.    At this point
the updated balance of $492.05 ($1192.05 - $1200 + $500) is recorded, along
with a minimum monthly payment of $30.

<P>
In the fifth month, the customer makes a payment of $475 and does
not charge any purchase.  Because there is an unpaid balance of
$17.05, an interest charge of $0.13 is added to the balance.
Therefore the new balance is $17.18 and the minimum payment assigned
for the subsequent month is also $17.18.


<hr>

<H1><A NAME="private">Your Private Implementation</A></H1>


<p>
Thus far, we have given a clear explanation of the public semantics of
the class, and examples of several scenarios.   However we have said
nothing at all about how you are to implement this.   Based on the
concept of encapsulation, it is up to you how to accomplish this.

<p>
You may feel free to add any <b>private</b> members to the
original definition in <tt>CreditCard.h</tt>.   Clearly, some basic
attributes will be necessary to store the information needed for the
standard accessor methods.   However you will likely need to store
additional internal information to properly support the
specifications.

<p>
We strongly suggest that you think a bit about your design before
getting too far into your implementation.



<hr>

<H1><A NAME="testing">Testing your Credit Card class</A></H1>

<P>
For this assignment, we wish to have you submit your own version of
a test program which utilizes the <tt>CreditCard</tt> class.   Your
test may only use the public behaviors which have been defined for
this assignment.


<p>
To get you going, we provide an initial implementation of
<a href="files/Test_CreditCard.cpp">Test_CreditCard.cpp</a>
which simulates the five months of activity as
described in the above example.   However, you should go on to add
additional such tests.   Those five months do not demonstrate a
complete set of scenarios which may arise.   We will certainly test
more possibilities when we grade your program!


<HR>


<H1><A NAME="grading"> Grading Standards</A></H1>

The assignment is worth <em>10</em> points.
<ul>
  <li>
      Eight points will be awarded based on our own evaluation of your
      assignment.
  </li>
  <li>
      One additional point will be awarded fractionally based on how
      well your program performs on other students' test.
  </li>
  <li>
      The final point will be awarded fractionally based on how well
      your test fools other students' flawed programs.
  </li>
</ul>


<HR>

<H1><A NAME="files">Files You Will Need</A></H1>

<P>
Rather than have the entire project in a single file, we would like to
shift to a more standard development practice where components of a
program are stored in a combination of different files which support
better reuse of components.  Please read Chapter&nbsp;1.6 of our text
for a discussion of this breakdown.

<p>
For this assignment, we are providing four files.
These can either be
<A href="files/">downloaded from this website</A>, or copied directly
into your account on <tt>turing</tt>, with the command
<pre>
    cp -R /public/goldwasser/180/programs/credit .
</pre>
</P>

<p>
The files are:
<UL>

  <LI>
      <P>
      <TT>CreditCard.h</TT> - The header file which contains the class definition.
      </P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
      <P>
      <TT>CreditCard.cpp</TT> - A file that should provide the bodies of
      the functions that were declared in CreditCard.h.
      </P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
      <P>
      <TT>Test_CreditCard.cpp</TT> - A file which serves as a main
      driver for testing the credit card. 
      </P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
      <P>
      <TT>makefile</TT> -  A makefile is a special configuration file
      which can help when trying to compile large projects with
      multiple pieces of source code.
      <b>
      Rather than invoking the compiler directly, you should be able
      to build an executable for this project by typing the simple
      command,</b>
      <blockquote>
      <tt>make</tt>
      </blockquote>
  </LI>

</UL>
</p>



<hr>

<H1><A NAME="submit">Submitting Your Assignment</A></H1>

<p>
Please see details regarding the <a href="../#submit">submission
process</a> from the general programming web page, as well as a
discussion of the <a href="../../index.html#late">late policy</a>.
</p>

<p>
Because this is a pair assignment, you should abide by the following
procedures:


<ul>
  <li>
      <p>
      Both members of the pair should submit a <tt>readme</tt> file
      (plain text format).  This provides a way for you to add any
      further comments you wish to make to the grader. In the case of
      a pair assignment, please give a brief overview of the breakdown
      of work and describe your personal role in the development of
      the submitted work.
  </li>
</ul>

<P>
In addition, one member of the team should submit the three source
code files:

<UL>

  <LI>
      <P>
      <TT>CreditCard.h</TT> - The header file which contains the class
      definition, akin to that of <NOBR>Code Fragment 1.5</NOBR>.
      </P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
      <P>
      <TT>CreditCard.cpp</TT> - A file which includes additional code
      providing the bodies of the member function for class CreditCard,
      akin to that of  <NOBR>Code Fragment 1.6</NOBR>.
      </P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
      <P>
      <TT>Test_CreditCard.cpp</TT> - A file which provides a main driver for
      testing the credit card.  Please make sure to adhere to
      the requirements as described in the above <A

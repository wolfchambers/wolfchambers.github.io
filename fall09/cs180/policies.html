      <P>
      This is an undergraduate course that is a follow-up to
      an introductory programming course.
      The goal of that first course can be viewed as gaining the
      ability to write computer programs for accomplishing tasks.  The
      key in that course was that programs must work
      <em>correctly</em> for the task at hand.  In this
      course, we will focus on the fact that there are actually many
      different ways to correctly solve a particular problem and that these
      different methods may vary greatly in <em>efficiency</em> and 
      <em>adaptability</em>.
      </P>
      
      <P>
      What we will find is that writing a "good" program is not as simple
      as starting with a correct program and then improving it.  Instead,
      the quality of a program is most determined by key thoughts and
      decisions that take place long before the first line of code might be
      written.  Relevant issues include the choice of data structures that
      are used to organize all of the information within a program, and the
      structure and level of generality which allow components of a program
      to be better maintained, reused, and adapted.
      </P>      

      <P>
      In hand with this emphasis on writing good programs and
      designing useful data structures, the course will reinforce
      aspects of object-oriented programming using
      the <b>C++ programming language</b>.
      Since the majority of
      students will enter this course having used Python in CSCI&nbsp;150,
      we do not assume any familiarity with C++ at the onset of this
      course.  In the early parts of the course, we will draw
      comparisons between these two languages to help in the
      transition.

      <p> Email contact with the course instructor is a necessity in this class, since homework will all
        submitted via email.  I will check email several times throughout the work day, and will also
      check email once per evening to answer questions and resolve issues.  Email contact over the 
      weekend may be more sporadic, although I will be sure to check at least once.

    <p> Computers will be an integral part of this course, both inside and
      outside of class.  However, out of courtesy to both the instructor and
      other students, please do not use the lab computers for non-class
      related activity.  In particular, you do not need to be using a computer
      unless an exercise or in class activity requiring them is in progress.
      </p>

    <p> You are unlikely to need cell phones during the course of lecture.  Please ensure that your cell phone is set to vibrate or silent during lecture, and do not send text messages of any kind.  </p>

    <li> <h3><A name="gradedwork">Graded Work</A></H3>
    <ul> 
      <li> Written Homework (20%)
      <P>
      We expect there to be a total of <A href="assignments/">8-10
      written homework assignments</A> during the course.
      At the end of the semester, <b>we will ignore your lowest of the
      homework grades,</b> with the remaining homeworks contributing
      equally to this portion of the grade. 
      </P>

      <P>
      Homeworks will
      generally be due at the beginning of class on the assigned due
      date. Late homeworks will not be accepted without previously given instructor approval! The problems will consist of short questions reinforcing
      the material in the lectures, readings and programs.
      Each homework will contain one or more practice
      problems that are not to be turned in and which can be
      discussed freely between classmates. The problems that
      are to be submitted for a grade, however, must be done
      entirely individually. A more complete explanation of our
      policy towards <A href="#integrity">Academic Integrity</A> is
      given below.
      </P>

	<p> As discussed <a href="#academicintegrity">below</a>, students are expected
	  to complete assignments individually and using only approved course materials. </p>

	<li>
      <H3>
      <A name="labs">Lab Assignments (10%)</A>
      </H3>

      <p>
      Most Thursdays will be devoted to a hands-on problem.
      Although we hope to have students complete it in class, we will
      allow each to be submitted anytime by 11:59pm on the following
      Friday.
      </p>

      <p>
      These problems will be essentially graded on a pass/fail scale.
      More formally, each will be worth up to 2 points.   Both points
      are awarded for a successful completion.  One point will be
      awarded for a sincere but unsuccessful attempt.  Zero points
      will be awarded for insufficient attempts.
      At the end of the semester, <b>we will ignore your lowest of the
      lab grades,</b> with the remaining scores contributing
      equally to this portion of the grade.
      </p>

	</li>

	<li> Programming Assignments (35%)
	
	<p> We expect about 8 programming assignments through the course of the semester.  For programming 
	assignments, late submissions will be accepted with a penalty of 10% per hour the assignment is late.  For 
	example, for a program due at 11:59pm, anything submitted between midnight and 12:59am will be worth at 
	most 90% of full credit; anything submitted between 6am and 6:59am will be worth at most 30% of the full 
	credit.</p>

      <P>
      On certain assignments, you will be required to work individually;
      on others you will be allowed to work in pairs.
      Early in the course you will have approximately one week for each
      assignment;  later in the course you will often have two weeks.</p>

	<p> Students will also be able to drop their lowest programming assignment score at the end of the semester.</p>

      <P>
      Letter grades will be based on each students overall
      percentage of awarded points according to the following
      formula.

	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage below 55% will result in a grade of
	    F.
	</DD>
      </DL>Any modification to this scale at the end of the year
      will be <EM>in favor of the students</EM>. That is we may
      later decide to award an A to a student who is slightly
      below the above cutoff, but we certainly will not deny
      an A from someone who is above the cutoff.
  </LI>

  <li> <H3><A name="extracredit">Extra Credit</A></H3>

      <P>The 
      programming and homework assignments provided will be challenging enough
      for most students, so I would like for students to focus on the 
      assignments provided. 
      </P>

      <p> Upon occasion (and solely at the instructor's discretion), some
      small extra credit activities may be included, either by announcement
      in class or as part of an assignment.  Please keep in mind that the extra credit is unlikely to
      significantly affect your grade; if you are concerned about your final grade, 
      it is much better to focus your energy on the regular assignment.  Extra 
      credit is solely designed to provide an opportunity to students who wish to 
      explore the topics further. </p>
      

  </li>

  <li> <h3><a name="latehomework">Late Homework</a></h3>

    <p> Late homework or programming assignments will suffer a penalty of 10% for every hour they are late.
	  For example, homework which is submitted between midnight and 12:59am will be worth at most 90%o of 
	  the total credit; anything submitted between 6am and 6:59am will be worth at most 30% of the full credit. 
    </p>
      

    <p> In unusual circumstances, such as extreme illness or injury (documented by a doctor's note), 
      family emergencies, etc., please contact the instructor as early as possible to arrange
      accomidations.  </p>

  </li>

  <li> <h3><a name="regrades">Regrade Requests</a></h3>

	<p> I am happy to regrade any assignments, programs, quizzes or exam problems which you think were unfair or incorrect.  Please bring me the original assignment, plus a written explanation of your question or complaint, within <em>two weeks</em> of the time the paper in question is graded and returned to you.

  </li>

  <li> <H3><A name="academicintegrity">Academic Integrity</A></H3>

<p> In the context of this course, I encourage students to discuss general course material, which
includes studying for exams, sharing notes if a student must miss class, and working on any practice
problems which are assigned.  We will also have occasional programming assignments that will be 
completed in pairs.  However, unless clearly stated otherwise in the assignment description, 
any work which will be submitted for a grade must
be completed by individuals.  In addition, the  <b> only </b> acceptable sources of information
are the course textbook, the instructor, official university tutors, or other sources which are 
explicitly mentioned in an assignment.  Students may <b>not</b> use other sources, including
(but not limited to) websites other than the official course website or those explicitly listed
in course materials, textbooks other than those officially listed below, or
students (either past or present). </p>

<p> Students who violate academic integrity policies will be reported to the department.  First time
offenses on homework will result in a minimum of a failing grade on the assignment in question, with
egregious or repeated offenses resulting in failure in the course.  In addition, students may be
referred to the College of Arts and Sciences for further disciplinary action.

    <p>The following is a statement of minimum standards for student academic integrity at Saint Louis University; I expect full compliance with the policies described.</p>

<p>The University is a community of learning, whose effectiveness requires an environment of mutual trust and integrity, such as would be expected at a Jesuit, Catholic institution. As members of this community, students, faculty, and staff members share the responsibility to maintain this environment. Academic dishonesty violates it. Although not all forms of academic dishonesty can be listed here, it can be said in general that soliciting, receiving, or providing any unauthorized assistance in the completion of any work submitted toward academic credit is dishonest. It not only violates the mutual trust necessary between faculty and students, but also undermines the validity of the University�s evaluation of students and takes unfair advantage of fellow students.</p>

<p>Further, it is the responsibility of any student who observes such dishonest conduct to call it to the attention of a faculty member or administrator.</p>

<p>Examples of academic dishonesty would be copying from another student, copying from a book or class notes during a closed-book exam, submitting materials authored by or editorially revised by another person but presented as the student�s own work, copying a passage or text directly from a published source without appropriately citing or recognizing that source, taking a test or doing an assignment or other academic work for another student, tampering with another student�s work, securing or supplying in advance a copy of an examination without the knowledge or consent of the instructor, and colluding with another student or students to engage in an act of academic dishonesty.</p>

<p>Where there is clear indication of such dishonesty, a faculty member or administrator has the responsibility to apply appropriate sanctions. Investigations of violations will be conducted in accord with standards and procedures of the school or college through which the course or research is offered. Recommendations of sanctions to be imposed will be made to the dean of the school or college in which the student is enrolled. Possible sanctions for a violation of academic integrity include, but are not limited to, disciplinary probation, suspension, and dismissal from the University. </p>

<ol>
  <li>
      <p>
      Open up a console window and change to the working directory of
      your choice. You may create a new directory with a command such
      as <br>
      <nobr><b><tt>mkdir csci180</tt></b></nobr><br>
      and then change to that directory with the command<br>
      <nobr><b><tt>cd csci180</tt></b></nobr><br>

  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      We are providing a directory containing sample C++ source code named <tt>gcd.cpp</tt>.
      Copy our directory into your working directory with the following
      command (note well the final period)<br>
      <nobr><b><tt>cp -R /Public/goldwasser/180/labs/lab0 .</tt></b></nobr><br>
      and then change into your copy of the directory as<br>
      <nobr><b><tt>cd lab0</tt></b></nobr><br>
  </li>


  <li>
      <p>
      That directory will contain the file <tt>gcd.cpp</tt>.
      You should see it in the listing of your directory with the
      command<br>
      <nobr><b><tt>ls</tt></b></nobr><br>

      <p>
      View the source code by opening the file with a text editor.
      A simple text editor on turing is called <tt>kate</tt>.  You may
      either type <tt>kate gcd.cpp</tt> in the console to start the program
      or look for it in the "Utilities" folder of the "K" menu at the
      bottom-left corner of your workspace.  If you want a more advanced
      text editor, my personal favorite is named <tt>emacs</tt>.
  </li>

  <li>
      <p>
      Our next goal is to compile the source code. We recommend doing
      this with the command<br>
      <nobr><b><tt>make gcd</tt></b></nobr><br>

      <p>
      <tt>make</tt> is not actually the C++ compiler, but a convenient
      utility that assits when building applications.
      When you execute that command, it invokes the actual compiler
      with a command such as<br>
      <nobr><b><tt>g++ gcd.cpp -o gcd</tt></b></nobr><br>

      <p>
      If you work on a system other than turing and you do not have
      <tt>make</tt> installed, you can compile your code by directly
      invoking <tt>g++</tt> as shown above.  Our reasons for prefer the
      use of <tt>make</tt> are that it is a simpler syntax and that
      <tt>make</tt> can better handle complex builds when we start to
      use multiple source files.  Make is also clever in that it won't
      recompile if the source code has not been modified since the
      last build.  For example, type
      <nobr><b><tt>make gcd</tt></b></nobr>
      again and see  how it responds.
  </li>

  <li>
      <p>
      After a successful compilation,  the output of the compiler
      will be an executable named <tt>gcd</tt>  (that file name was
      dictated with the syntax <tt>-o gcd</tt> when g++ was invoked).
      <p>
      You should be able to see that file in the listing of your
      directory with the command<br>
      <nobr><b><tt>ls</tt></b></nobr><br>

  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      The executable can be run from your working directory using the command<br>
      <nobr><b><tt>./gcd</tt></b></nobr><br>
      try the following interactions<br>
<pre>
First value: <b>30</b>
Second value: <b>18</b>
gcd: 6
</pre>      
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      Use the program to calculate the greatest commond divisor of
      the values 9772444 and 3297294.  Record the result.
  </li>
</ol>

<P>
To complete this lab, create a text file named <tt>lab0.txt</tt> with
the following format:
<pre>
Lab 0
your_name_here
gcd_result_here
</pre>
then submit the file <tt>lab0.txt</tt> via email to the instructor.  Please make the title of your email "CS180: lab0", and attach the file lab0.txt.

Extra time?  Open the source code again in a text editor and try the
following.

<ol start=9>
  <li>
      <p>
      Go to line 7 and insert the characters <tt>//</tt> at the
      beginning of the line (turing that line into a comment). Now
      go back to the console and type<br>
      <nobr><b><tt>make gcd</tt></b></nobr><br>
      What is the compiler's complaint?
      <p>
      Uncomment line 7 to restore the original file.
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      Delete the first <tt>int</tt> that begins line 4 and try to
      rebuild the program. What is the compiler's complaint?
      <p>
      Restore line 4 to its original form.
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      Go to line 19 and change the characters <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> to
      <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>.  What is the compiler's complaint?
      <p>
      Restore line 19 to its original form.
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      Go to line 8 and remove the <tt>{</tt> character near the end of
      the line and try again to make the project.  This time, the
      compiler complains about line 13.  Why?
      <p>
      Restore the <tt>{</tt> at line 8 before continuing.
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      Comment out line 13 (by prefixing it with <tt>//</tt> and try to
      rebuild.  This time, the make succeeds.  Rerun the resulting
      executable and recalculate the gcd of 30 and 18.  What happened?
      
      <p>
      Restore line 13 to its original form.
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      Experiment with other changes to the source code and see what happens.
  </li>
</ol>

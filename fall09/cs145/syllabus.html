	<p> This course aims to present the basics of computer programming likely 
to be useful in a science discipline.  In addition, we will cover modeling 
techniques.  We will present the programming skills alongside carefully selected 
scientific problems; in each case, students will have learned the necessary skills 
to successfully write a program to model an applied problem in mechanics or a 
similar area of physics and engineering.  
      </P>
          
	<p> In this setting, students are encouraged to treat the class as a highly 
interactive process; questions about both aspects (the underlying math or science 
as well as the necessary programming) are welcome at any time.  Since mathematical 
background is likely to be varied, we will assume little beyond basic calculus, but 
might cover additional topics necessary to examine a particular application.
	<\p> 

	<p>The languages covered will be matlab and C++.  We will begin with 
matlab, which is arguably more essential for scientific modeling, since it contains 
a wide variety of tools which make such models easy to construct and visualize.  
However, like many such programming language, it also becomes quite slow on large 
inputs or computationally intensive tasks.  Therefore, once our models become 
sufficiently cumbersome in matlab, we will switch to C++ and present the basics of 
this faster (but somewhat less intuitive) language.

<ul>

    <li> <h3><A name="gradedwork">Graded Work</A></H3>
    <ul> 
      <li> Written Homework (25%)
      <P>
      We expect there to be a total of <A href="assignments/">10-12
      written homework assignments</A> during the course.
      At the end of the semester, <b>we will ignore your 2 lowest
      homework grades,</b> with the remaining homeworks contributing
      equally to this portion of the grade. 
      </P>

      <P>
      Homeworks will
      generally be due at the beginning of class every Monday. Late homeworks will 
not be accepted without previously given instructor approval! The problems will 
consist of short questions reinforcing
      the material in the lectures, readings and programs.
      Each homework may contain one or more practice
      problems that are not to be turned in and which can be
      discussed freely between classmates. The problems that
      are to be submitted for a grade, however, must be done
      entirely individually. A more complete explanation of our
      policy towards <A href="#integrity">Academic Integrity</A> is
      given below.
      </P>

	<p> As discussed <a href="#academicintegrity">below</a>, students are 
expected
	  to complete assignments individually and using only approved course 
materials. </p>


	<li> Programming Assignments (40%)
	
	<p> We expect 6-8 programming assignments through the course of the 
semester.  For programming 
	assignments, late submissions will be accepted with a penalty of 10% per 
hour the assignment is late.  For 
	example, for a program due at 11:59pm, anything submitted between midnight 
and 12:59am will be worth at 
	most 90% of full credit; anything submitted between 6am and 6:59am will be 
worth at most 30% of the full 
	credit.</p>

      <P>
      On certain programss, you will be required to work individually;
      on others you will be allowed to work in pairs.
      Programs will be due approximately every two weeks, and will usually be due 
on Fridays.</p>

	<p> Students will also be able to drop their lowest programming assignment 
score at the end of the semester.</p>

	<li> Exams (35%)

    </ul> 

    </li>

    <LI> <H3><A name="percentages">Percentages</A></H3>

      <P>
      Letter grades will be based on each students overall
      percentage of awarded points according to the following
      formula.
      </P>
      
      <DL>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 90% will result in a grade of
	    A or better.

	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 87% will result in a grade of
	    A- or better.

	    Student percentage above 84% will result in a grade of
	    B+ or better.
	</DD>

	    Student percentage above 60% will result in a grade of
	    D or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage below 60% will result in a grade of
	    F.
	</DD>
      </DL>Any modification to this scale at the end of the year
      will be <EM>in favor of the students</EM>. That is we may
      later decide to award an A to a student who is slightly
      below the above cutoff, but we certainly will not deny
      an A from someone who is above the cutoff.
  </LI>

  <li> <H3><A name="extracredit">Extra Credit</A></H3>

      <P>The 
      programming and homework assignments provided will be challenging enough
      for most students, so I would like for students to focus on the 
      assignments provided. 
      </P>

      <p> Upon occasion (and solely at the instructor's discretion), some
      small extra credit activities may be included, either by announcement
      in class or as part of an assignment.  Please keep in mind that the extra 
credit is unlikely to
      significantly affect your grade; if you are concerned about your final grade, 
      it is much better to focus your energy on the regular assignment.  Extra 
      credit is solely designed to provide an opportunity to students who wish to 
      explore the topics further. </p>
      

  </li>

  <li> <h3><a name="latehomework">Late Homework</a></h3>

    <p> Late homework or programming assignments will suffer a penalty of 10% for 
every hour they are late.
	  For example, homework which is submitted between midnight and 12:59am 
will be worth at most 90%o of 
	  the total credit; anything submitted between 6am and 6:59am will be worth 
at most 30% of the full credit. 
    </p>
      

    <p> In unusual circumstances, such as extreme illness or injury (documented by 
a doctor's note), 
      family emergencies, etc., please contact the instructor as early as possible 
to arrange
      accomidations.  </p>

  </li>

  <li> <h3><a name="regrades">Regrade Requests</a></h3>

	<p> I am happy to regrade any assignments, programs, quizzes or exam 
problems which you think were unfair or incorrect.  Please bring me the original 
assignment, plus a written explanation of your question or complaint, within 
<em>two weeks</em> of the time the paper in question is graded and returned to you.

  </li>

  <li> <H3><A name="academicintegrity">Academic Integrity</A></H3>

<p> In the context of this course, I encourage students to discuss general course 
material, which
includes studying for exams, sharing notes if a student must miss class, and 
working on any practice
problems which are assigned.  We will also have occasional programming assignments 
that will be 
completed in pairs.  However, unless clearly stated otherwise in the assignment 
description, 
any work which will be submitted for a grade must
be completed by individuals.  In addition, the  <b> only </b> acceptable sources of 
information
are the course textbook, the instructor, official university tutors, or other 
sources which are 
explicitly mentioned in an assignment.  Students may <b>not</b> use other sources, 
including
(but not limited to) websites other than the official course website or those 
explicitly listed
in course materials, textbooks other than those officially listed below, or
students (either past or present). </p>

<p> Students who violate academic integrity policies will be reported to the 
department.  First time
offenses on homework will result in a minimum of a failing grade on the assignment 
in question, with
egregious or repeated offenses resulting in failure in the course.  In addition, 
students may be
referred to the College of Arts and Sciences for further disciplinary action.

    <p>The following is a statement of minimum standards for student academic 
integrity at Saint Louis University; I expect full compliance with the policies 
described.</p>

<p>The University is a community of learning, whose effectiveness requires an 
environment of mutual trust and integrity, such as would be expected at a Jesuit, 
Catholic institution. As members of this community, students, faculty, and staff 
members share the responsibility to maintain this environment. Academic dishonesty 
violates it. Although not all forms of academic dishonesty can be listed here, it 
can be said in general that soliciting, receiving, or providing any unauthorized 
assistance in the completion of any work submitted toward academic credit is 
dishonest. It not only violates the mutual trust necessary between faculty and 
students, but also undermines the validity of the Universityï¿½s evaluation of 
students and takes unfair advantage of fellow students.</p>

<p>Further, it is the responsibility of any student who observes such dishonest 
conduct to call it to the attention of a faculty member or administrator.</p>

<p>Examples of academic dishonesty would be copying from another student, copying 
from a book or class notes during a closed-book exam, submitting materials authored 
by or editorially revised by another person but presented as the studentï¿½s own 
work, copying a passage or text directly from a published source without 
appropriately citing or recognizing that source, taking a test or doing an 
assignment or other academic work for another student, tampering with another 
studentï¿½s work, securing or supplying in advance a copy of an examination without 
the knowledge or consent of the instructor, and colluding with another student or 
students to engage in an act of academic dishonesty.</p>

<p>Where there is clear indication of such dishonesty, a faculty member or 
administrator has the responsibility to apply appropriate sanctions. Investigations 
of violations will be conducted in accord with standards and procedures of the 
school or college through which the course or research is offered. Recommendations 
of sanctions to be imposed will be made to the dean of the school or college in 
which the student is enrolled. Possible sanctions for a violation of academic 
integrity include, but are not limited to, disciplinary probation, suspension, and 
dismissal from the University. </p>

    <p>Any student who feels that he or she may need academic accomidations in 
order to meet the
      requirements of this course, as outlined in the syllabus, due to the presence 
of a disability, 
      should contact the Student Success Center.  Please call the office at

      <P>
      As stated in the <A href="#integrity">Academic Integrity</A> policy,
      these workers are an acceptable resource for help, yet
      you should still document both the source of the help as well as
      the extent, if significant.

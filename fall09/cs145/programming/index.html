      <H2>Programming Assignments</H2>

We expect to have 6-8 programming assignments during this course.
Your lowest score will be dropped at the end of the
course and your remaining scores will be averaged.

Please make sure you understand the policy towards <a href="../#integrity">Academic Integrity</a>.
<p>
Programming assignments are due via email to the instructor by 11:59pm on the 
date specified.  Please be sure to email all relevant files for your program, 
as well as a description of which file to run (if there is a any question). 
Late submissions will be penalized in accordance with our <a
href="../#late">Late Policy</a>.

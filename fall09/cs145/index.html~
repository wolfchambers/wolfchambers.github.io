<h3> Announcements: </h3>
<ul>

<li><p>Nov. 23: <a href=http://www.planetpdf.com/developer/article.asp?ContentID=6634">Here</a> is a link to a download site for <b>Thinking in C++</a>, by Bruce Eckel.  This a good C++ reference if you forget how to do something - in particular, the first few chapters should have helpful discussion and answers to questions.  The schedule page has also been updated, so all in-class examples are now available online.

<li><p>Nov. 19: Two handouts are available: <a href="bash.pdf">one</a> on basic command line prompts and compiling a program, and <a href="comparison.pdf">another</a> which compares matlab and C++ programs, to give you an idea of the differences between the two languages.

<li><p>Nov. 19:  <a href="homework/hw6.pdf">Homework 6</a> is available.  It will be due on Monday, Nov. 30, by 9am.  Please be sure to submit 3 cpp files for this one, and include your name in comments inside the program.

<li><p>Nov. 19: If you are using a PC and don't wish to connect with NX, I'd recommend <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuTTY</a>, a simple ssh client.  Download it and connect to turing.slu.edu, and log in with your normal password and username.  One note - you won't be able to use kate on this type of connection.  I'd recommend trying nano, a simple text editor.  Just cd to the correct folder and type "nano filename.cpp" to open the file.  You'll use the arrow and letter keys to move around and type (never the mouse), and save and exit by typing control-x.

<li><p>Nov. 10: Regular tutoring hours will resume today, so you can go to 121 Ritter between 3:30 and 5:30 if you want extra help.

<li><p>Nov. 9: <a href="mt2practice.pdf">Practice problems for midterm 2</a> are now 
available.

<li><p>Nov. 9: For your checkpoint on program 4, at 1080 Hz you should be getting 
about a 
13.2 dB loss output.  (The number we gave was 720, which is incorrect.)     

<li><p>Nov. 6: We discovered a few other errors in the update rules for 
the programming assignment, so reload and get the new version.    

<li><p>Nov. 4: A new version of <a 
href="programming/muffler.pdf">program 4</a>, with the update rule for transparent boundaries fixed.

<li><p>Oct. 30: <a href="programming/muffler.pdf">Program 4</a> is avialable; it will 
be due Tuesday, November 10 by 11:59pm.

<li><p>Oct. 30: <a href="wave-equation.pdf">Here</a> is a handout about wave 
equations.

<li><p>Oct. 22: <a href="homework/hw5.pdf">Homework 5</a> is available; it will be due next Thursday via email by 9am.

<li><p>Oct. 14: I am extending the due date on program 3 to Sunday, 
October 25 by 11:59pm.

<li><p>Oct. 14: My office hours tomorrow (Thursday) will be from 
11-12am, instead of 9-10am.  Please 
email me if that causes a problem, and we can schedule another time.

<li><p>Oct. 13: There was a slight bug in the homework.  The first value 
of problem 2 (when x is less than -1) should have been 15, not 20.  A 
new version has been uploaded, but everything else is identical.

<li><p>Oct. 12: <a href="programming/rocket.pdf">Program 3</a> is 
available; it will be due Saturday, October 24 by 11:59pm.   

<li><p>Oct. 10: <a href="homework/hw4.pdf">Homework 4</a> is available; it 
will be due next Friday by 9am.

<li><p>Sept. 30: <a href="mt1practice.pdf">Here</a> is a set of sample problems for midterm 1.  

<li><p>Sept. 29: I may have to reduce my office hours for the rest of the week, since my daughter has been tested for swine flu and will probably be home sick for a while.  Classes will still meet at the usual time, and I will be available via email, but Dr. Letscher has agreed to open up his office hours since I may not be on campus as much as I expected.  His office is in 005 Ritter Hall (a few doors down from me), and he does have office hours on Wendeady and Thursday.  See his <a href="http://dehn.slu.edu/">homepage</a> for details.

<li><p>Sept. 27: <a href="difference.pdf">A handout</a> covering the material from the past week or so is available. 

<li><p>Sept. 27: The first exam will be Monday, October 5 in class.  There will be a review session on Friday, October 2, so that you may ask any questions about material on the exam.

<li><p>Sept. 19: <a href="programming/suspension.pdf">Program 2 </a> is 
available; it will be due next Thursday, Sept. 31, by 11:59pm.

<li><p>Sept. 14: <a href="homework/hw3.pdf">HW3</a> is available; it 
will be 
due next Monday by 9am.

<li><p>Sept. 2 (@4pm): There was a bug in the initial version of the 
programming assignment; please download and print a new copy of you got it 
before 4pm today.

<li><p>Sept. 2: <a href="programming/bridge.pdf">Program 1</a> is out; it is due 
via email by 11:59pm on Saturday, September 12.

<li><p> Aug. 31: <a href="homework/hw2.pdf">Homework 2</a> is now 
available; it will be due Monday by the start of class.

<li><p> Aug. 28: I have posted the <a href="linsolve.pdf">linsolve</a> handout 
for those who wish to use it for solving systems of linear equations; right 
division (see Ch. 3.3 of the text) is also completely acceptable. 

<li><p> Aug. 28: The general use computer lab in McDonnell-Douglas (for those 
who wish to use it) is in room 2030 M-D.

<li><p> Aug . 26: Tutoring hours were announced incorrectly in class 
today; they are every Tuesday from 3:30 to 5:30 in 121 Ritter Hall. 

<li><p> Aug. 26: The software for remote connections (called nx client) is available for download freely <a href="http://www.nomachine.com/download.php">here</a>; make sure to get the free client and not the server.  Information about connecting is available <a href="http://mathcs.slu.edu/computing-resources/remote-access
">here</a>.  Please email me if you have any password troubles, or if the account I created for you has the wrong username.

<li><p> Aug. 25: Matlab should now be available in the computer lab in our classroom or any other computer lab in that building.  In addition, we'll talk about remote connection options tomorrow in class.

<li><p> Aug 25:  <a href="homework/hw1.pdf">Homework 1</a> is now available; it will be due on Monday at the start of class.

<h3> Announcements: </h3>
<ul>

<li><p>May 8:  Slight correction - I had a type here, but our final is Wednesday at 8am (not 8pm), in the same room as our usual classes.  Sorry for any confusion!

<li><p>May 5: <a href="finalreview.pdf">Here</a> is a tentative set of review questions for the final exam.

<li><p>April 21: The final exam will be Wednesday, May 10, at 8am.  I'll post a review sheet here the week before, and will hand out a sample final exam on the Friday before the final.  The last class (Monday, May 8) will be a review session for the final exam.

<li><p> April 21:  <a href="homework/hw11.pdf">Homework 11 (the final essay)</a> is posted; I'm getting this one up early so that you all can better time your last few weeks.  It's not due until Friday, May 5, at the start of class.  The required reading for this essay is: 
<br>
<a href="http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~lpara/LETTURE/backus.pdf">Can programming be liberated from the von Neumann style?</a>
<br>
<a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf">Why functional programming matters</a>

<li><p> April 19: <a href="homework/hw10.pdf">Homework 10</a> is available; it will be due next Friday, 4/28, by 11:59pm.

<li><p> April 17: Apologies, but there are two typos on homework 9 that are probably making part g difficult.  The nats fucntion should make the infinite list 0,1,2,..., and the ruler function should be the largest power of 2 that evening divides n.  (My text editing software compiled that incorrectly - sorry for the inconvenience!)

<li><p> April 3: <a href="homework/hw9.pdf">Homework 9</a> is available; it will be due on Wednesday, April 19, by 11:59pm.

<li><p> April 3: <a href="homework/hw8.pdf">Homework 8</a> is available; it will be due next Monday, April 10, by 11:59pm via email.

<li><p> March 27: <a href="homework/hw7.pdf">Homework 7</a> is available; it will be due next Monday, April 3, by 11:59pm via email.


<li><p> March 15: <a href="homework/hw6.pdf">The second essay (homework 6)</a> is now available; this is a longer essay.  It will be due on Monday, 3/27, by the start of class.

<li><p> March 1: As a reminder, the midterm exam is next Friday (3/10) in class.  The <a href="mtreview.pdf">midterm review</a> sheet has been posted, and a sample midterm will be handed out in class this Friday (3/3) for study purposes.

<li><p> Feb. 26: <a href="homework/hw5.pdf">Homework 5</a> is available; it will be due on Monday, March 6. 

<li><p>Feb. 24: There is a bug in problem 2 of the homework; the string I chose, while accepted by the grammar, cannot actually be parsed by this LL(1) predictive parsing.  
Please just submit your parsing action up to the point where no rule will work; you should end with 2 non-terminals on the stack that can't be gotten rid of (since they won't go to epsilon).  Apologies for the error!  To make it up, I'll add an extra credit problem as part d of number 2: find a string that can be parsed using this algorithm, and show me the parsing action.  (Note: to keep you from giving a trivial one, your string must be at least 5 characters long!)

<li><p>Feb. 20: <a href="homework/hw4.pdf">Homework 4</a> is available; it will be due next Monday, 2/27. (Edited 2/22: link from this page is now fixed.)

<li><p>Feb. 10: A quick update on homework 4: it will be a paper 
homework covering parsing, passed out by Dr. Fritts next week in class, and will be due 
on Wednesday, Feb. 22 in class.

<li><p>Jan. 29:  <a href="homework/homework3.html">Homework 3</a> is available; it will be due next Wednesday, 2/8, by 11:59pm.  Please submit your files via email to the instructor, but be sure that they compile and work on hopper or in the computer lab before submitting. 

<li><p> Jan. 25: <a href="homework/hw2.pdf">Homework 2</a> is now available; it will be due next Wednesday, Feb. 1, by the start of class.

<li><p> Jan. 18: <a href="homework/homework1.pdf">The first homework</a> is available; it will be due in 1 week, by the start of class (9am) on Wednesday, January 25.

<li> <p> Welcome to programming languages!  Please make sure to read the course 
policies carefully, and remember to check this announcements section 
daily for new announcements or reminders.

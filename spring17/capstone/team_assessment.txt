		      Team Peer Evaluation Form
                      -------------------------

[Note: This format is based on one from CSE 134A at UCSD, another 
from U. Fresno, as well as software engineering sprint assessments 
developed by Dr. Scannell here at SLU.]

Each team member is to complete the following questionnaire on his or 
her team-mates.  Ratings and comments made by each member will used to 
help the instructor evaluate the performance of each student; note that 
grades are not necessarily directly based on these, but they may be used 
to determine when additional scrutiny is required.  All information will 
be held in strictest confidence; only the instructor, group supervisor, 
and (where necessary) the chair of CS will be privy to results of peer 
evaluations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Give the names of your team members. Include yourself as person A.

  A:
  B:
  C:
  D:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(2) Fill in the table below for each team member.  Note that for effort, 
please keep your rating to average, above average, or below average, as a 
way of measuring this person's contributions to the project relative to 
everyone else.  (Note: Not everyone can be above average!)

Be thoughtful and honest when discussing what scores each team member
should receive.  Remember that most people have both strengths and
weaknesses.  Do not give unbelievable scores.

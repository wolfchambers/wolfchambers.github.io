</H2>



<p>
The Capstone Project serves a a
concluding achievement for graduating students, allowing them to apply knowledge that they have gained 
from the Computer Science curriculum toward a year-long
project. Formally, the project is completed as part of a two-semester,
sequence of 2-credit courses: CSCI&nbsp;4961 (Capstone
Project&nbsp;I) and CSCI&nbsp;4962 (Capstone Project&nbsp;II).
</p>


<p>
Key roles in the capstone course are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Student Team</b>
      <br>
      Each project is to be completed by a team of students, although
      in some cases, that team may consist of a single student.
      </p> 
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Instructor</b>
      <br>
      The instructor-of-record for the course is responsible for the
      administration of the course, scheduling of presentations, and
      record keeping regarding grades.
      </p> 
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Supervisor</b>
      <br>
      Each project will have a "Supervisor" who is a CS faculty member
      who will oversee the team on the project, and can be a sounding
      board on technical issues. 
      The Supervisor may or may not be the Instructor-of-record for the course.
      </p> 
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Client</b>
      <br>
      For some projects, there will be a clearly identified "Client"
      who originally proposed the project or is a potential end user
      of the result. The client might serve as a primary
      point-of-contact in shaping the desired specification for an end
      product and to provide feedback on early prototypes.
      </p> 
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The Supervisor and the Instructor will work together in grading the
performance of the teams. The Client has no formal responsibilities in
regard to evaluation.
</p>

<HR>
<H2>
<a name="outcomes">Course Outcomes</a>
</H2>

<p>At the conclusion of the capstone project, the following course outcomes should be accomplished.  Note that these will vary slightly if the project is a reseach project, as these outcomes are designed for the more traditional software design route.

<UL>
  <LI>Students can draft requirements specifications and design documents for a software project after consultation with a client, including the development of a project plan with reasonable timeline and effort estimates.
  <LI>Students can design and implement a medium-to-large scale software product using a software requirements specification.
  <LI>Students can use a range of software tools in support of the development of their software product.
  <LI> Student can create, evaluate, and implement a test plan for their software.
  <LI>Students can explain and present their via an oral presentation.
</UL>


<HR>
<H2>
<A name="projects">Project Selection</A>
</H2>

<p>
During the opening weeks of CSCI&nbsp;4961, students are responsible
for working with the instructor, potential supervising faculty, and
peer students in order to build teams, explore project ideas, and
develop a concrete plan for the year, culuminating in a formal
contract (see below).
</p>

<p>
Typically, the instructor will circulate a list of potential
projects to consider. These projects are often suggested by CS faculty
members based on research endeavors or educational tools, are based on
requests coming from members of the broader SLU community, or in some
cases from external non-profit groups. Student teams are also welcome
to suggest their own projects for approval. The goal is to pursue
projects that have an appropriate scope for a year-long sequence,
having a richness in both design aspects and use of technology.
For the sake of example, we provide <a href="/~goldwasser/courses/slu/capstone/general">this list of some past
project descriptions</a>.
</p>

<p>
At the conclusion of the initial period, teams must sign a
<a href="handouts/contract">contract</a>, together with the Supervisor
and Instructor, providing a high-level project description and
detailing the requirements for successful completion, and key
checkpoints during the process. This year, the contract must be signed
by Friday, January&nbsp;27, 2017
.
</p>

<HR>
<H2>
<a name="timeline">Project Timeline, Deliverables, Presentations</a>
</H2>

<p>
Each project is unique, and teams may adopt one of a variety of 
project management styles. However, all teams must adhere to the following
checkpoints and timeline (details of which follow).

<ul>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Deliverables</b>
      <br>
      Given the wide range of projects, there is no one-size-fits-all
      definition for the deliverables, but as part of the initial
      contract, the students and Supervisor should outline four major
      stages of the project, that are to be achieved by the four
      checkpoints in our timeline (middle of first semester, end of
      first semester, middle of second semester, end of second semester).
      </p>
      <p>
      For teams following a traditional waterfall model, 
      likely checkpoints are as follows:
      <ul>
	<li>
	    </p>
	    Deliverable #1: Requirements Specification
	    <br>
	    A writen document that clearly define the goals of the
	    final product, in terms of functionality, user interface,
	    resource usage, and other such factors. This document
	    should include a project overview, any necessary
	    background knowledge, and an enumeration of formal
	    requirements specification for the eventual product
	    (e.g.,&nbsp;"Requirement&nbsp;7b").  
	    </p>
	    <p>For more than you ever wanted to know about this process, 
	    read the <a href=http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse870/IEEEXplore-SRS-template.pdf">
	    IEEE overview</a> of what such documents should contain.  Other 
	    <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/CSC340F/slides/17-specifications.pdf">
	    overviews<a/> and examples are available online.  Keep in mind that 
	    these are relatively small scale projects, but we do expect you to
	    be able to formally specify what your team will do in 5-10 pages, not 
	    including things like use cases or UI diagrams.
	</li>
	<li>
	    <p>
	    Deliverable #2: Design Document
	    <br>
	    A writen document that describes a detailed design for achieving the
	    formal requirements. A design document should
	    include a description of the major components, their interfaces
	    and how they interact to form the whole. 
	    Figures should be included for clarity, such as a UML diagram of
	    the software design or an ER-diagram for a database.
	    This document should also contain a discussion of any
	    third-party technologies or software packages that will be
	    used in meeting the project goals. Teams should demonstrate that
	    they have already evaluated and familiarized themselves with
	    any such technologies.
	    Finally, this document must include a proposed time-line for the
	    remainder of the project life cycle, making sure to include
	    specific sub-goals for the development, implementation, and
	    testing phases of the project.
	    </p>

            <p>
	    Again, many different references exist online for how to write 
	    such a design document, and many of you have probably discussed 
            it in classes such as software engineering.  See the instructor if you
	    have questions or would like to see examples.
	    </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	    <p>
	    Deliverable #3: Alpha Version
	    <br>
	    The alpha version of the project is a preliminary
	    implementation that includes all
	    <em>major</em> functionality of the final product, yet may lack some
	    advanced features, have a less polished interface, and contain
	    some known bugs.
	    </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	    <p>
	    Deliverable #4: Final Product
	    <br>
	    The final product must be submitted, including complete
	    source code, documentation for deployment and usage,
	    database schemas, analysis, and so on, as appropriate for
	    the project. 
	    </p>
	</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
      Note that these expectations may vary.  For example, 
	for teams following an agile development process, the
      deliverables are more naturally going to be a series of
      working products with increasing refinement.
      For teams exploring research-driven questions, the
      deliverables might be papers that describe the work and results.
      See the course instructor if you have any questions about 
      what your work should incorporate for your specific project.
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Presentations</b>
      <br>
      The teams will make four presentations during the
      two-semester sequence, typically just after a recent deliverable
      was submitted.
      Each presentation will be scheduled with 20&nbsp;minutes
      for a formal presentation, followed by up to 10&nbsp;minutes of
      questions from faculty members in the audience.
      Teams should prepare <b>polished presentation materials</b> and
      for most projects include a <b>live demonstration</b> of the
      current state of a product.
      Teams should also make sure to test the presentation and
      demonstrations in the Linux lab, well in advance of their
      scheduled presentation.
      </p>
	<p>
Note that at a minimum, each member of the team is expected to discuss their
specific contribution to the project, as well as challenges that came up for 
their component along the way.  While no specific attire or presentation format
is required, professional presentations generally do score better.  At a minimum,
teams must also have some sort of slide show that introduces and discusses their project in 
general before presenting any demos or technical details, as they should expect 
new members of the audience each time who may not be familiar with prior presentations.
<\p>
<p>Note also that every student is required to attend at least 2 other presentations, not including their own; this requirement is including in final presentations grades.  Please contact the instructor if scheduling of the presentations makes this a hardship, and accommodations will be considered on a case by case basis (with good justifications).

  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Weekly Reports</b>
      <br>
      Each team is responsible for submitting a brief progress report during
      class each Friday of the semester.  During the initial period,
      when teams have not yet been formed, each individual should discuss
      what progress has been made in researching potential projects
      and teams; these first Friday meetings are a good place to form groups
or discuss ideas with other students looking for a team. 
Once a contract is in place for a project, all
      subsequent weekly reports will happen in class and should incorporate
      details from each member of the team, each speaking for him or her self. 
      Please inform the instructor in advance if you need to miss the class meeting;
      up to two absences can be replaced with emailed weekly reports, but any 
      absences beyond the first two will result in a grade penalty.
      </p>
      <p>
      A report should indicate what was accomplished during the week <em>by
      each team member</em>, what challenges were encountered, and a plan for
      activities in the upcoming week.
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      <b>Team Self-Assessment</b>
      <br>
	Each individual
	must complete and submit a <a href="team_assessment.txt"><em>Team Self-Assessment Form</em></a>,
	detailing his or her perception of the contributions of each team
	member.  This assessment is due to the instructor by the Thursday after
	the final presentation each semester.
      </p>
  </li>
</ul>



<HR>
<H2>
<a name="grading">Grading</a>
</H2>

<p>
Each semester of the capstone project is graded based
upon the performance during that semester. The evaluation of students
artifacts and presentations will be made by a combination of the
Instructor and project Supervisor. The overall grade will be weighted
as follows:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>
      5% Weekly Reports
  </li>
  <li>
      20% Deliverable #1 (CSCI&nbsp;4961) or Deliverable #3 (CSCI&nbsp;4962)
  </li>
  <li>
      15% Midterm Presentation
  </li>
  <li>
      45% Deliverable #2 (CSCI&nbsp;4961) or Deliverable #4 (CSCI&nbsp;4962)
  </li>
  <li>
      15% Final Presentation
  </li>
</ul>
</p>



<p>
Letter grades will then be assigned based on the following formula.


<DL>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 93% will result in a grade of
      A or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 90% will result in a grade of
      A- or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 87% will result in a grade of
      B+ or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 83% will result in a grade of
      B or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 80% will result in a grade of
      B- or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 77% will result in a grade of
      C+ or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 73% will result in a grade of
      C or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 70% will result in a grade of
      C- or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage above 60% will result in a grade of
      D or better.
  </DD>
  <DD>
      Student percentage below 60% will result in a grade of
      F.
  </DD>
</DL>

Although team members will typically receive similar grades, in
some cases the Instructor and Supervisor may consider the
relative contribution of individual team members in assigning
individual grades.

<HR>
<H2>
<A name="repo">Repository for Project Artifacts</A>
</H2>


<p>
<b>
All teams will be required to use git repositories on turing for all
project artifacts (e.g., weekly reports, all deliverables, source
codes, presentation materials).
</b>
More details about the process will be forthcoming.

<H2>
<A name="integrity">Academic Integrity</A>
</H2>

      <P>
      Academic integrity is honesty, truthful and responsible conduct
      in all academic endeavors. The mission of Saint Louis University
      is "the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for
      the service of humanity."  Accordingly, all acts of falsehood
      demean and compromise the corporate endeavors of teaching,
      research, health care, and community service via which SLU
      embodies its mission. The University strives to prepare students
      for lives of personal and professional integrity, and therefore
      regards all breaches of academic integrity as matters of serious
      concern.
      </p>
      <p>
      The governing University-level Academic Integrity Policy can be
      accessed on the <a

<A name="success">Supporting Student Success</A>
</H2>

<p>
In recognition that people learn in a variety of ways and that learning is influenced by multiple factors (e.g., prior experience, study skills, learning disability), resources to support student success are available on campus.  Students who think they might benefit from these resources can find out more about:
<ul>
  <li>
      Course-level support by asking the Instructor
  </li>
  <li>
      University-level support (e.g., tutoring/writing services, Disability Services) by visiting the Student Success Center (BSC 331) or by going to <a href="http://www.slu.edu/success">www.slu.edu/success</a>.
</ul>

<p>
Students with a documented disability who wish to request
academic accommodations are encouraged to contact
<A href="http://www.slu.edu/services/daa/disabilities_services.html">Disability Services</A> at <nobr>314-977-3484</nobr> or visit the Student Success Center.  Confidentiality will be observed in all inquiries.

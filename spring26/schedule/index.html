<hr> <blockquote>

<p>Here is this semester's tentative schedule; I will update 
it as the semester progresses. 

<p>Please note that lecture notes are provided as a supplement, and are NOT a 
substitute for attending lecture.  In particular, these are not guaranteed, so 
expect technical difficulties to prevent them from being posted at least a few 
times in the semester; they also will not contain exercises whose solutions are
worked out on the board in class.  Please plan accordingly to either take notes or get them 
from a friend if necessary.

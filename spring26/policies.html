<h3><A name="catalog"><b>Course Description:</A></b></h3>

A study of theoretical foundations of computer science and a selection of 
important algorithm techniques. Topics include the classes of P and NP, the 
theory of NP-completeness, linear programming, advanced graph algorithms, 
parallel algorithms, approximation algorithms, and randomized algorithms. 


<H3><A name="outline">Course Outline</A></H3>

The course covers a broad set of topics in algorithms design and analysis, 
with an emphasis on their applications. The goal is to cover tools and 
algorithms that give students the ability to recognize which tool or 
method to apply to problems, become reasonably proficient at using these 
tools; and be able to reason about the correctness and performance of the 
resulting algorithms. After a review of basic data 
structures and algorithmic principles, we will investigate topics from areas 
such as randomized algorithms, hashing and 
streaming, flows and linear programming, convex optimization, approximation, 
and dimension reduction, depending upon student interest in various topics.

<H3><A name="textbook">Course Materials</A></H3>

The material of the class will primarily come from the following references, 
both available freely online: 

<ul>
  <li> <a 
href="https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/">Algorithms</a>, by 
Jeff Erickson
  <li> <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15850/notes/cmu850-f20.pdf">Advanced 
Algorithms</a>, by Anupam Gupta
</ul>

  In addition, I pull material from the following texts, all of which are excellent references if 
you find yourself in need of a different explanation or proof style to understand some of the 
concepts.  (Note that all of these additional references are available in the library or 
can be purchased cheaply from a used bookseller; you can also look at them in my office, if you want to look them over.)
<ul>

</ul>

<h3><A name="attendance">Attendance Policy</a></h3>
In general, I won't be taking attendance in lectures. However, you will miss important material if 
you are not present, including homework discussion/hints as well as discussion about the final 
project. You are responsible for any material covered in class; this includes course material as 
well announcements such as changes in due dates, extra hints or corrections, etc.
I will do my best to also post these in the lecture 
notes on the schedule page, but that is a courtesy and not a requirement, so please plan 
accordingly! If you will miss a lecture, I'd suggest checking with a fellow student, since my tablet 
does occasionally fail. You're also welcome to check in with me with any questions.

<h3><A name="gradedwork">Graded work:</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li> <h3>Homework (40%)</h3> There will be homework due (almost) every week, for a total of about 
10-12 homework assignments over 
the course of the semester. Some homeworks will be written assignments turned in on Gradescope, 
while others will be presented orally 
to the instructor. See the homework page for more details.<br> 

For all homeworks, you are allowed to submit in groups of 2-3. In fact, given the difficult nature 
of the 
assignments, I encourage all of you to work with another student, as the best way to learn this 
material is to discuss and problem 
solve in a small group.
      
  <li><h3>Reading (10%)</h3> I will be uploading reading assignments from the course text to 
Perusall this semester. Your grade for 
reading is then set by the system based on how you comment on and interact with the material 
assigned. (Please come talk to me during 
the semester if you notice odd grades, as I'm happy to tinker with the grading system they use if 
needed!)  I do not extend any 
reading due dates, but at the end of the semester will drop the lowest 3 scores, to cover any 
illness or technical issues that 
prevent completion.<br>
A reading assignment will be due every morning we have class, at 8am.  I plan to use your comments 
and questions to target lecture to 
the topics you are confused on.
 </li>


  <li><h3>Exams (50%)</h3></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Midterm (20%): Tentatively scheduled for Tuesday March 3 - stay tuned in case this 
changes.</li>
    <li>Final Exam (30%): The tentative university time we are assigned is Monday, May 4 7:30 
PM - 9:30 PM.  (I can't control this date, so I will update if the university decides to change 
it.)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>


<H3><A name="percentages">Percentages</A></H3>
Letter grades will be based on each students overall percentage of awarded points according to the 
following formula.<br>

      <DL>

	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 93% will result in a grade of
	    A or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 90% will result in a grade of
	    A- or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 87% will result in a grade of
	    B+ or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>

	    Student percentage above 83% will result in a grade of
	    B or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 80% will result in a grade of
	    B- or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 77% will result in a grade of
	    C+ or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 73% will result in a grade of
	    C or better.
	</DD>

	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 70% will result in a grade of
	    C- or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 60% will result in a grade of
	    D or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage below 60% will result in a grade of
	    F.
	</DD>
      </DL>

<br> Any modification to this scale at the end of the year will be <i>in favor of the students</i>. 
That is we may later decide to award an A to a student who is slightly below the cutoff, but we 
certainly will not deny an A from someone who is above the cutoff.




<h3><a name="regrades">Regrade Requests</a></h3>
I am happy to regrade any assignments which you think were unfair or incorrect. Please email me a 
written explanation of your question; you are also welcome and encouraged to come discuss it with 
me, as that can often be helpful in understanding the issue better.

<h3><a name="lifeclause">Life Clause policy</a></h3>

In general, late assignments will not be accepted or graded.  However, life does happen, and 
occasionally emergencies come up.  So, once per semester, you are welcome to get a 3 day extension, 
with no questions asked or no details needed, on any homework assignment.  Please email myself and 
the TAs before 11;59pm on the due date, if you choose to exercise this.
<br>

Note that this policy does *not* apply to Persusall readings.  I will  drop your lowest three 
readings at the end of the semester, so that if you miss one or two due to travel or illnes, it will not hurt that 
portion of your grade. 


<h3><a name="children">Policy on Children in class</a></h3>

    For any student raising children, I understand that minor illnesses and unforeseen disruptions 
in childcare often put parents in the position of having to chose between missing class to stay home 
with a child and leaving him or her with someone you or the child does not feel comfortable with. 
While this is not meant to be a long-term childcare solution, occasionally bringing a child to class 
in order to cover gaps in care is perfectly acceptable. (You are likely to meet mine at some point 
this semester!)
All exclusively breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as is necessary to support the 
breastfeeding relationship. Because not all women can pump sufficient milk, and not all babies will 
take a bottle reliably, I never want students to feel like they have to choose between feeding their 
baby and continuing their education. You and your nursing baby are welcome in class anytime.
I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment that is respectful of all 
forms of diversity, including diversity in parenting status. In all cases where babies and children 
come to class, I ask that you sit close to the door so that if your little one needs special 
attention and is disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until their need has 
been met. Non-parents in the class, please reserve seats near the door for your parenting 
classmates. (Policy adapted from Dr. Melissa Cheyney)

<H3><A name="academicintegrity">Academic Integrity</A></H3>

As I am sure you are all aware, Notre Dame students are expected to abide by Academic Code of Honor 
Pledge. “As a member of the Notre Dame community, I acknowledge that it is my responsibility to 
learn and abide by principles of intellectual honesty and academic integrity, and therefore I will 
not participate in or tolerate academic dishonesty."
In addition:             
“All students must familiarize themselves with the Honor Code on the University’s website and pledge 
to observe its provisions in all written and oral work, including oral presentations, quizzes and 
exams, and drafts and final versions of essays.”
When in doubt about whether something is allowable, don’t assume that you are right – ask me first.

<p> In the context of this course, I encourage students to discuss general course 
  material, which includes working on homework or practice problems, or discussing projects and 
sharing ideas.
  You are also 
allowed to turn in homework assignments in pairs.  I also encourage you to discuss 
problems with other students, but please be careful to write up all solutions 
separately in your own group, and do not copy any material from another student.  
As a good rule of thumb, make sure to write your solutions without using any notes 
  or papers written while talking to anyone other than your partner.


  <p> You are allowed to use outside sources of information in this class, including 
textbooks and webpages.  If the complete and correct answer is on page 263 of the 
textbook, the best solution you can submit is "See page 263 of the text." Period.  
However, if you find a solution from any other source, such as a web page, a 
journal paper, a different algorithms textbook, or your mom, <b>you must rewrite 
the solution in your own words, and you must properly cite your sources</b>. Assume 
the graders have access to all the official course material, but nothing else. 
While we strongly encourge you to use any outside source at your disposal, please 
remember that the homework is supposed to demonstrate that your understanding 
material, not just how to use Google or LLMs. In particular, verbatim copying is worth 
NOTHING, and will be considered a violation of the academic integrity policy.  
(Note that I'm also pretty good with google as well as ChatGPT, so I wouldn't recommend copying!)
We strongly encourage you to use any printed, online, or living resource at your disposal to help 
you solve homework problems, but you must cite your sources.
<ul class=compact>
<li> If you use an idea from a book, cite the book.
<li> If you use an idea from a paper, cite the paper.
<li> If you use an idea from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>, cite 
Wikipedia.
<li> If you use an idea from <a href="http://cs.stackexchange.com/">CS StackExchange</a>, <a 
href="http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/352/how-will-you-cite-a-discussion-on-this-site-in-your-paper">cite</a> 
CS StackExchange.
<li> If you use an idea from last semester's homework solutions, cite last semester's homework 
solutions.
<li> If you use an idea from the class slack channel, cite the class slack channel.
<li> If you use an idea from another student, cite that student.
<li> If you use an idea from Chegg, cite Chegg.
<li> <b>If you use an idea from ChatGPT, cite ChatGPT.</b>
<li> If you use an idea from the bathroom graffiti at Fiddler's Hearth, cite the bathroom graffiti 
at Fiddler's Hearth.
</ul>
<b>This is not an exhaustive list!</b>

<p>
In general, just remember that submitting someone else's work without giving them proper credit is 
plagiarism, <em>even if you have the other person's explicit permission</em>.  Submitting someone 
else's work without giving them proper credit is plagiarism, <em>even if that “someone else” is a 
computer program</em>.  Citing your sources will <em>not</em> lower your homework grade.

<p>
Allowing someone else to use your ideas without giving you credit is also an academic integrity 
violation.


<p> Students who violate academic integrity policies will be reported to the department, 
particularly in cases where relevant sources are not cited or in cases of direct copying of another 
student's work.  First time
offenses on homework will result in a minimum of a failing grade on the assignment in question, with
  egregious or repeated offenses resulting in failure in the course.

   <H3><A name="accommodations">Accommodations and disability services</A></H3>

It is the policy and practice of The University of Notre Dame to provide reasonable accommodations 
for students with properly documented disabilities. Students who have questions about Sara Bea 
Accessibility Services or who have, or think they may have, a disability are invited to contact Sara 
Bea Accessibility Services for a confidential discussion by emailing at sarabeacenter@nd.edu or by 
phone at 574-631-7157. Because the University’s Academic Accommodations Processes generally require 
students to request accommodations well in advance of the dates when they are needed, students who 
believe they may need an accommodation for this course are encouraged to contact Sara Bea 
Accessibility Services at their earliest opportunity. Additional information about Sara Bea 
Accessibility Services and to learn more about the student process for requesting accommodations, 
please visits <a 
href="https://supportandcare.nd.edu/for-students/current-students/accessibility-support/">Accessibility 
Support</a>. As an instructor, I encourage you to utilize these services, and feel free to reach out 
if you'd like to discuss how this might help in the context of this specific class.


 <H3><A name="environment">Learning environment</A></H3>

The University of Notre Dame is committed to a safe and excellent education for all student 
enrolled, regardless of background. I share that commitment and strive to maintain a positive 
learning environment based on open communication, mutual respect, and non-discrimination. In this 
class we will not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, age, economic class, disability, veteran 
status, religion, sexual orientation, color or national origin. Any suggestions as to how to further 
such a positive and open environment will be appreciated and given serious consideration.

<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Techniques for designing efficient computer algorithms and for analyzing computational costs of algorithms. Common design strategies such as dynamic programming, divide-and-conquer, and Greedy methods. Problem-solving approaches such as sorting, searching, and selection; lower bounds; data structures; algorithms for graph problems; geometric problems; and other selected problems. Computationally intractable problems (NP-completeness).</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s3"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Prerequisites:</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">CSE 30141 (Theory of Computing) and CSE 20312 (Data structures), or equivalent</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Course Materials:</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">Our primary textbook will be Algorithms, by Jeff Erickson.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Note that you’ll be completing readings on Perusall, but you are welcome to also download a pdf or purchase a paperback version as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is also a webpage associated with many homework and exam practice questions, which can be a good resource for studying.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">In addition, I pull material from the following texts, all of which are excellent references if you find yourself in need of a different explanation or proof style to understand some of the concepts:</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Attendance policy:</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">In general, I won't be taking attendance in lectures. However, you will miss important material if you are not present, including occasional opportunities for extra credit, hints on the homework, and guidance on studying for exams. You are responsible for any material covered in class; this includes course material as well announcements such as exam dates, changes in homework due date, etc. I will do my best to also post these in the lecture notes and/or in course announcements on Canvas, but that is a courtesy and not a requirement, so please plan accordingly! If you will miss a lecture, I'd suggest checking with a fellow student, since my tablet does occasionally fail. You're also welcome to check in with me with any questions.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Graded work:</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li8"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s3">Homework (40%)There will be homework due (almost) every week, for a total of about 10-12 homework assignments over the course of the semester. Some homeworks will be written assignments turned in during class, while others will be presented orally to the instructor.<br>
For all homeworks, you are allowed to submit in groups of 2-3. In fact, given the difficult nature of the assignments, I encourage all of you to work with another student, as the best way to learn this material is to discuss and problem solve in a small group.<br>
As discussed <a href="https://wolfchambers.github.io/fall19/algorithms/policies.html#academicintegrity"><span class="s5">below</span></a>, students are expected to complete assignments using only approved course materials.</span></li>
  <li class="li8"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s3">Reading (10%):I will be uploading reading assignments from the course text to Perusall this semester. Your grade for reading is then set by the system based on how you comment on and interact with the material assigned. (Please come talk to me during the semester if you notice odd grades, as I'm happy to tinker with the grading system they use if needed!)</span></li>
  <li class="li8"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s3">Exams (50%)</span></li>
  <ul class="ul2">
    <li class="li8"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s3">Midterm (20%): TBD</span></li>
    <li class="li8"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s3">Final Exam (30%): TBD</span></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p class="p8"><span class="s6"><b>Percentages<br>
</b></span><span class="s3">Letter grades will be based on each students overall percentage of awarded points according to the following formula.<br>
Student percentage above 93% will result in a grade of A or better.<br>
Student percentage above 90% will result in a grade of A- or better.<br>
Student percentage above 87% will result in a grade of B+ or better.<br>
Student percentage above 83% will result in a grade of B or better.<br>
Student percentage above 80% will result in a grade of B- or better.<br>
Student percentage above 77% will result in a grade of C+ or better.<br>
Student percentage above 73% will result in a grade of C or better.<br>
Student percentage above 70% will result in a grade of C- or better.<br>
Student percentage above 60% will result in a grade of D or better.<br>
Student percentage below 60% will result in a grade of F.<br>
<br>
Any modification to this scale at the end of the year will be <i>in favor of the students</i>. That is we may later decide to award an A to a student who is slightly below the cutoff, but we certainly will not deny an A from someone who is above the cutoff.<br>
No matter what curve I impose, I maintain that the minimum passing grade for this class is a 50% - so if your average is lower than that, you will fail this class.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s6"><b>Extra Credit<br>
</b></span><span class="s3">In general, extra credit will not be assigned in this class. The homework assignments provided will be challenging enough for everyone, so I would like for students to focus on the assignments provided.<br>
Upon occasion (and solely at the instructor's discretion), some small extra credit activities may be included, either by announcement in class or as part of an assignment. Please keep in mind that the extra credit is unlikely to significantly affect your grade; if you are concerned about your final grade, it is much better to focus your energy on the regular assignment. Extra credit is solely designed to provide an opportunity to students who wish to explore the topics further.<br>
And no, you can't say "I don't know" on an extra credit problem to get 25% of the points!</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s6"><b>Late Homework<br>
</b></span><span class="s3">Homeworks will generally be due at 11:59pm on canvas, or (if an oral presentation) will be due during the time slot you sign up for in class. Late submissions will generally not be accepted unless arrangements have been made ahead of time. Please contact me as early as possible with any potential issues, since I am much more likely to grant an extension if you come to be ahead of time! In general, I try to be flexible if students have good reason, but I do reserve the right to not accept late submissions if solutions have already been released or if a student is abusing this flexibility.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s6"><b>Regrade Requests<br>
</b></span><span class="s3">I am happy to regrade any assignmentss or exam problems which you think were unfair or incorrect. Please bring me the original assignment, plus a written explanation of your question or complaint, within <i>two weeks</i> of the time the paper in question is graded and returned to you.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s6"><b>Policy on Children in Class:<br>
</b></span><span class="s3">For any student raising children, I understand that minor illnesses and unforeseen disruptions in childcare often put parents in the position of having to chose between missing class to stay home with a child and leaving him or her with someone you or the child does not feel comfortable with. While this is not meant to be a long-term childcare solution, occasionally bringing a child to class in order to cover gaps in care is perfectly acceptable. (You are likely to meet mine at some point this semester!)<br>
All exclusively breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as is necessary to support the breastfeeding relationship. Because not all women can pump sufficient milk, and not all babies will take a bottle reliably, I never want students to feel like they have to choose between feeding their baby and continuing their education. You and your nursing baby are welcome in class anytime.<br>
I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment that is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in parenting status. In all cases where babies and children come to class, I ask that you sit close to the door so that if your little one needs special attention and is disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until their need has been met. Non-parents in the class, please reserve seats near the door for your parenting classmates. (Policy adapted from Dr. Melissa Cheyney)</span></p>

<h3> Announcements: </h3>
<ul>

  <li> <p> Jan 13: <a href="homeworks/hw0.pdf">Homework 0</a> is available; it will be due next 
Thursday, Jan 22, on gradescope.

  <li> <p> Jan 9: In the worst timing ever, I will be traveling out of town for our first day of 
class.  Instead of a sub, I've decided to assign a longer introductor reading and make a 
Panapto video introducing the class, syllabus, and structure, as well as an introductory survey 
to let me learn more about you.  Please refer to Canvas to watch the video, and make sure to do 
the survey and the first reading assignment before Wednesday at 11:59pm.  I will see you 
Thursday for our first in person class!

  <li> <p> Welcome to Algorithms!  I'll be using this page to post public 
information, 
including lecture notes and announcemets;  please check Canvas for homework 
submission and the class gradebook.
      Please make sure to read the <a href="policies.html">course policies</a> 
carefully, and 
remember to check this announcements section regularly for
      new announcements or reminders.

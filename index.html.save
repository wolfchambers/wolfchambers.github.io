<h4>About Me</h4>

<img src ="Erin1.jpg" align=right alt="Me">

I am an assistant professor in the <a 
href="http://mathcs.slu.edu/>Department of Mathematics and 
Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.slu.edu">Saint Louis 
University</a>.  I teach computer science classes, and research problems in 
computational topology and geometry as well as combinatorics and 
combinatorial algorithms.  I am also interested in retention and 
recruitment issues in computer science, particularly as they relate to 
women and minorities.

I did a bachelors in computer science, Masters in mathematics, and PhD in 
computer science at  <a 
href="http://www.uiuc.edu">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>
in the <a href="http://www.cs.uiuc.edu">Computer Science department</a>.  
My PhD 
advisor was <a href="http://compgeom.cs.uiuc.edu/~jeffe/"> Jeff
Erickson</a>.

<p>

I'm married to <a href="turtle.jpg">Jeff Chambers</a>.  We have a little
girl,
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/73942029@N00/">Grace</a>, and
a guinea pig <a href="Jeff_pig.jpg">Boca</a>.
In my spare time, I read a lot of books, watch various TV shows, and drink 
<a href="http://www.uptontea.com">tea</a>.

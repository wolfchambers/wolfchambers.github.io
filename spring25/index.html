<h3> Announcements: </h3>
<ul>

  <li><p> May 7: One final reminder: we will have our exam tomorrow (Thursday) at 10:30am, in 303 Cushings (our usual classroom).  See 
you all there!

  <li><p>May 7: Here are <a href="sample-final-solutions.pdf">solutions to the sample final</a>. Note that I opted to make these handwritten, to try to give a sense of how I would have written it up on a final, but let me know if you have any questions.

  <li><p> May 2: I have just updated the <a href="sample-final.pdf">sample final exam</a> to have the list of NP-Hard problems at the end of the pdf.  This is how they will appear on the final exam next week.

  <li><p> May 1: The review session will be next week on Tuesday from 12:30-2:30pm, in 217 Cushing.  I'll also have office hours from 1-3pm on Wednesday in my office. 
 
  <li><p> April 24: The <a href="sample-final.pdf">sample final exam</a> is now available.  Again, your exam will follow the same 
general format and topics, although of course the questions will differ!  We will have a review session on the last day of
class, next Wednesday, so please bring your questions (on this or other subjects).

  <li><p> April 22: I will have extra office hours this week: Tuesday 3-4pm, Wednesday 1-2pm, and Thursday at both 11am-noon and 2-3pm.  Note that all office hours next week are canceled, as oral grading starts on Monday!

  <li><p> April 16: HW 5 is now graded.  This is a good chance to remind folks: please double check that grades have synced correctly for you to Canvas.  We had some group issues with syncing, as well as regrades not syncing, so let me know of issues!  Also, at this point all regrades sent via email have been completed, so if you have a regrade request pending, please email me to follow up, as I did not get the request to consider.

  <li><p>April 15: HW 8 (the last homework) is now posted.  This will be our second orally graded homework.  Please join a Canvas group under the HW8 groups, then sign up for one time for your group to come present your solutions in my office.  

  <li><p>April 11: HW 5 solutions are now posted.  The graders are working to finish this assignment, so grades should appear by next week.

  <li><p> April 9: I've extended the deadline for HW7 until next Monday.  HW8 will be due the last week 
of classes, and we will no longer have a HW9.

  <li><p>March 31: As announced in class, there will be no class next Monday, 4/7, and office hours that day are cancelled and moved to Wednesday the 9th from 1-3pm.  (We will have class and office hours as usual today though!)


  <li><p>March 26: For those who want to play with demos, I can recommend this website for shortest paths and for flows (our next chapter): <a href="https://visualgo.net/en/sssp?slide=1">https://visualgo.net/en/sssp</a>.

  <li><p>March 20: Office hours today are shifted slightly from the usual times: I'll be available from 1-2:30. 


  <li> <p>March 5: Tomorrow, a mid-semester evaluation will be coming to you all via email.  This is nothing officially recorded, but is 
rather just a checkpoint for me, so I can get a sense of what is working and what you all are struggling with in the course.  Please 
do complete it and give feedback, if you have thoughts on what is good or bad!  I will use it to adjust course practices where I am 
able, in order to better support you, or can share information on why things are structured a particular way based on the comments.

  <li><p> March 5: Homework 5 is posted; it will be due the Friday after break, via Gradescope.

  <li><p> March 2: I have just posted<a href="sample-midterm-solutions.pdf">solutions to the practice 
midterm</a>.  
In addition, all homework solutions up to HW4 are posted on the <a href="homeworks">homework page</a>.  I am happy to discuss any 
questions about these during the review sesison in class on Monday.

  <li><p> Feb 21: The <a href="sample-midterm.pdf">sample midterm exam</a> is now available.  Your exam will follow the same 
general format and topics, although of course the questions will differ!  We will have a review session on Monday March 3 in 
class, so please bring your questions (on this or other subjects).

  <li><p> Feb. 21: Due to bug in gradescope settings, group submissions were not enabled on HW3.  Please go back and tag your group members today if at all possible - I will not count these as late, since this was an error in the submissions system.


  <li><p> Feb. 19: HW 4 is posted.  This will be our first orally graded homework!  Please sign up for a group slot in Canvas, and register for a time on Wednesday 2/26, Thursday 2/27, or Friday 2/28 with your group.  (See the Canvas announcement for more links on how to sign up for a spot.)  I also recommend reviewing the "How to present" reminders on the <a href="homeworks/index.html">Homework</a> page at the bottom, to get familiar with format and expectations.

  <li><p> Feb. 12: HW 3 is posted, and the solutions for HW1 are now available.

  <li> <p> Feb 3: HW 2 has been posted; you may work again in groups, and please submit on Canvas.  Also, note that office hours for Matthew Eleazar have been moved permanently to be on Wednesday and Friday; see the course policies page for details.

  <li> <p>Jan 31: <a href="homeworks/hw0-solutions.pdf">HW0 solutions<a/> have been added to the <A 
HREF="homeworks/">homework</a> page.

  <li> <p>Jan 31: Reminder that office hours were moved to today (Friday) at 3:15 by TA Matthew Eleazar.  
Check the slack for details.

  <li> <p>Jan 15: Due to flu and associated breathing issues, class will be on zoom today.  Please check Canvas or slack for the 
announcement with details.

  <li> <p>Jan 9: Welcome to Algorithms!  I'll be using this page to post public information, including lecture notes and announcements; please check Canvas for homework submission and gradebook.
      Please make sure to read the <a href="policies.html">course

      new announcements or reminders.

<H1><A NAME="overview">Overview and Task</A></H1>

<P> For this assignment, you must implement the remove method for 
the AVL Tree class.  The general idea was covered 
in class, and you may refer to lecture notes or come talk to me with questions. </p>

<p>For this assignment, you are welcome to implement any helper functions 
you need - just be careful to put them in a protected or private setting 
if they are not something an end user should have access to.  More 
likely, you will want to use the functions provided in BinaryTree.h, both 
for the tree and for iterators. </p>

<p>Note: For simplicity, we are assuming that your trees will only store 
distinct elements.  So if a value is inserted twice, you do not need to 
have it represented twice in your tree.  You DO need to handle this case 
without crashing, however! </P>

<H1><A NAME="debug">Debugging Your Program</A></H1>

<p> Write a function called testAVL.cpp which creates a binary 
search tree and performs inserts and removes on the tree.  
You are welcome to use the draw function (inherited from BinaryTree.h) to 
draw your tree at each step and debug your code. </p>

<p>Again, feel free to write other test functions - such as a function 
that prints the height of a node, or an inorder traversal of the tree - 
if that is helpful for your debugging process. </p>

<H1><A NAME="files">Files We Are Providing</A></H1>

<P> All such files can be downloaded from the <a 
href="../schedule/index.html">schedule</a> page, except the makefile, which is available <a href="makefile">here</a> </P>

<UL>
  <LI>
      <P>
      <tt>BinaryTree.h</tt> and <tt>BinarySearchTree.h</TT> and <TT>AVLTree.h</TT>
      <BR>
      These are the implementations of the Binary Tree, Binary Search
Tree, and AVL trees from our work in class.
      <p>
      Note:  For the sake of simplicity, we did not bother to separate
      out the function bodies for the class into a separate
      cpp files.  All the function bodies are embeded
      directly into the header.  You should make your changes directly
      to the .h file as well.
  </LI>

  <LI>
      <P>
      <TT>makefile</TT>
      <BR>
      This makefile should allow  you to rebuild your project by
      simply typing 'make' rather than in invoking the compiler
      directly.
      </P>

<UL>
  <LI>
      <P>
      <a name="code">Source Code</a>
      <br>
      Submit your revised <tt>AVLTree.h</tt> files. 
      Note that you should not need to alter BinaryTree.h or BinarySearchTree.h, 
      so please let me know in your readme if you make any changes there 
      (and explain why they are needed).
  </LI>
  <LI>
      <P>
      <a name="test">testAVL.cpp</a>
      <br>
      A sample program that creates an AVL tree and walks through 
a set operations, checking that inserting and removing elements works
for any possible setup of the tree.
  </LI>
  <LI>
      <P>
      <a name="readme">"readme" file</a>
      <br>
      Discuss an overview of your
      final product, and any further comments you
      wish to make to the grader, including known bugs, design decisions,
      or extra functions that you implemented (and why).
      </P>

<H1><A NAME="grading">Grading Standards</A></H1>

<P>
The assignment is worth <em>10</em> points. 

Your test file will be worth 3 points; please be sure to comment and document which test cases cover which structural situations, as this is a key part of testing in this class.  Your readme and discussion is worth .5 points.

The remaining  points will be given for working remove code in the AVL Tree class. </P>

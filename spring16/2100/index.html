<h3> Announcements: </h3>
<ul>

<li><p> April 21: <a href="homework/hw11.pdf">Homework 11</a> is 
available; it will be due on Friday, April 29.  Note that this 
assignment is due in class, and there will be no extensions, as will be 
grading them that weekend and covering solutions when reviewing for the 
final exam.

<li><p> April 21: As mentioned in class, note that the final day of class (Monday, May 2) will be an in class review; our final is Wednesday, May 4, at 8am.

<li><p>April 15: Note that I made a minor modification to the assignment; for those that would like to attempt it, there is an extra credit section now added to the bottom of  <a href="homework/homework10.html">Homework 10</a>.  (It is not at all required, but some of you may like to think about it after you get your main program working.)

<li><p>April 11: I announced an extension for hw9 today in class; it is now due on Wednesday instead of Tuesday this week. (Note: the code on the schedule page should be fine to use - there was no bug in it, but I'm happy to give the extra day for those who would like to use the time.)

<li><p>April 8: <a href="homework/homework10.html">Homework 10</a> is available; it will be due on Wednesday, April 20.  You may work with a partner on this homework.  Note that you will need to download the binary tree class included here, and not the one on the schedule page.  (You should not need to alter BinaryTree.h at all, and the functions should work exactly the same as what we did in class.)

<li><p> April 1: <a href="homework/homework9.html">Homework 9</a> is available; it will be due on Tuesday, April 12, via email to me (and not the grader for this one).  You are welcome to work with a partner on this one.

<li><p> March 28: Midterm 2 will be in 1 week, on Monday, April 4.  There will be a review session in class on Friday, April 1.

<li><p>March 23: Please refresh and download new copies of BinarySearchTree.h and BinaryTree.h, as I had to make a minor modification to the code; the new version are now what the schedule page links to, so you can get them there.  (You should be able to paste in any code you have already written to these new files with no issues.)

<li><p>March 21: <a href="homework/homework8.html">Homework 8</a> is available; it will be due next Tuesday, March 29, by 11:59pm.  Note that you are welcome to work with a partner on this assignment.

<li><p> March 16: <a href="homework/hw7.pdf">Homework 7</a> is available; it will be due (either on paper or scanned via email) at the beginning of class next Tuesday, March 22.

<li><p> Feb. 23: <a href="homework/hw6.pdf">Homework 6</a> is available; it will be due after the break, on Tuesday, March 15, by 11:59pm.  Please email the files to the grader and myself as usual.

<li><p> Feb. 23: <a href="homework/hw5.pdf">Homework 5</a> is available; it will be due next Thursday, March 3, by 11:59pm, via email to both myself and the grader.

<li><p> Feb. 8: The first midterm is coming up; it will take place in class on Monday, Feb. 22.  We will have an in-class review session on Friday, May 19, and I will also pass out a sample midterm during class this Friday or next Monday.

<li><p> Feb. 8: <a href="homework/homework4.html">Homework 4</a> is available; it will be due next Wednesday, Feb. 17.  Please note that you may work with a partner on this homework, and that it should be submitted to the instructor (and not the grader).

<li><p> Feb. 2: <a href="homework/hw3.pdf">Homework 3</a> is available; it will be due next Tuesday, Feb. 9, via email (to both me and the grader).

<li><p>Jan. 25: I have made a <a href="homework/makefile">makefil</a> for your Rational.h class (assuming you call your test file testRational.cpp); let me know if you have any issues using it, although you are not required to.

<li><p> Jan. 22: <a href="homework/hw2.pdf">Homework 2</a> is available; it will be due by Sunday, Jan. 31, at 11:59pm (to both me and the grader).  Note that if you wish to hand in the first problem on paper, you are welcome to submit it before class starts Monday morning.

<li><p> Jan. 12: <a href="homework/hw1.pdf">The first homework</a> is now available; it will be due next Friday, Jan. 22, by 11:59pm.  Note that this homework must be done individually, and should be submitted via email to both me and the grader (whose email is given in the homework).

<li><p> Jan. 11: <a href="python2cpp.pdf">Here</a> is a link to the transition guide we will be using as a reference for the first 2-3 weeks of the class.  

<li> <p> Welcome to data structures!  Please make sure to read the course 
policies carefully, and remember to check this announcements section 
daily for new announcements or reminders.

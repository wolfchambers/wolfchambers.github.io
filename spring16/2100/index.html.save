<h3> Announcements: </h3>
<ul>

<li><p> Feb. 1: A last minute change to our schedule this week: lab 3 will happen on Wednesday, instead of Tuesday.  We will still have class on Tuesday, but it will be a normal lecture (covering stacks).  The lab will then be due on Saturday at midnight (instead of the usual Friday deadline).y


<li><p>Jan. 25: I have made a <a href="homework/makefile">makefil</a> for your Rational.h class (assuming you call your test file testRational.cpp); let me know if you have any issues using it, although you are not required to.

<li><p> Jan. 22: <a href="homework/hw2.pdf">Homework 2</a> is available; it will be due by Sunday, Jan. 31, at 11:59pm (to both me and the grader).  Note that if you wish to hand in the first problem on paper, you are welcome to submit it before class starts Monday morning.

<li><p> Jan. 12: <a href="homework/hw1.pdf">The first homework</a> is now available; it will be due next Friday, Jan. 22, by 11:59pm.  Note that this homework must be done individually, and should be submitted via email to both me and the grader (whose email is given in the homework).

<li><p> Jan. 11: <a href="python2cpp.pdf">Here</a> is a link to the transition guide we will be using as a reference for the first 2-3 weeks of the class.  

<li> <p> Welcome to data structures!  Please make sure to read the course 
policies carefully, and remember to check this announcements section 
daily for new announcements or reminders.

<h1>Fall 2017 Topology Seminar: <br> An Overview of Computational Topology</h1>

</center>


<hr> <blockquote>

<p>Computational topology is an emerging area at the intersection of math and computer 
science, growing from the increasing need for algorithmic computation that is rooted in 
the tools and techniques of topology.  Specific topics we plan to cover include 
topological data analysis and persistent homology, surface reconstruction, 3-manifold 
algorithms, graphs on surface, and higher dimensional algorithmic and hardness results.  
A familiarity with either topology or algorithms recommended, but the level is geared for 
graduates students in either mathematics or computer science, and necessary background 
will be introduced along the way.

<p>The schedule below will be updated as the semester progresses, including slides or any useful associated reading.</p>

<p>Title: Topological Data Analysis: History and Challenges</p>

<p>Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has it's roots in applied algebraic topology 
and has grown into a set of tools that have been applied to a wide range of application 
domains.  We will examine the history of TDA and, as it gets used more frequently to study 
scientific data, the challenges for its use for statistical analysis and prediction.  We 
will also discuss the connections of the methods with algebraic topology, low-dimensional 
topology and algorithms.</p>

<p>Title: Tools from computational geometry</p> 


<p>Abstract: Computational topology draws on many constructs from computational geometry, 
a closely allied area whose focus is designing and implementing algorithms to solve 
geometric problems.  In particular, for problems such as surface reconstruction or 
topological data analysis, we often use the classic computational geometry construction of 
a Voronoi diagrams (and its dual, the Delaunay triangulations).  In this lecture, we will 
introduce these constructs and their uses. No prior algorithms or computational geometry 
expertise is needed.

<p>Title: Reconstructing surfaces from point scans</p>


<p>Abstract: 

A fundamental problem when representing or analyzing object is the following: given a set of 
points, generally produced by scanning some object (i.e. in applications such as motion 
capture, facial recognition, medical imaging, etc.), reconstruct a triangulation on these 
points which accurately represents the original object.  We will survey classical results 
and algorithms from this area, focusing especially on the crust and powercrust algorithms, 
which were some of the first to give provable guarantees on the quality of the 
reconstruction, both from a topological and a geometric standpoint.

<p>Title: An introduction to persistent homology</p>


<p>Abstract:

We provide a comprehensive introduction to persistent homology in two parts.  We will go through multiple definitions for 
persistence and examine the original algorithm for its calculation.  Multiple representations for persistence 
will also be examined.  No prior knowledge of homology is required.

<p>Title: Graphs on Surfaces</p>


<p>Abstract:
This week, we'll introduce and consider some of fundamental topological 
questions for graphs on surfaces, such as finding the shortest 
topologically nontrivial cycle or computing maximum flows and minimum 
cuts in them.  Such problems are not only natural ones to consider from 
a topological graph theory perspective, but also many applications in 
combinatorial optimization, graphics, and graph drawing.  Algorithms for 
these problems are often considerably more tractable than for general 
graphs, and build on a large body of work from planar graphs.

This talk will build on prior discussion of homology and homotopy, but 
should be fairly accessible for those that missed earlier weeks in the 
seminar.

<p>Title: Homology flows (and cohomology cuts)</p>

<p>Abstract: 
This week, we'll continue discussing topological algorithms for graphs 
embedded on surfaces, as built from surface reconstructions algorithms 
like the ones we saw in week 3.  We will focus on how homology and 
cohomology connect to computing maximum flows and minimum cuts, both of 
which are fundamental problems in graph theory. Again, the topic will be 
kept accessible for those who missed prior discussions of homology or 
who are less familiar with graph algorithms.

<p>Generalized Persistent Homology: Part 1, Modules</p>

<p>Abstract: We will examine multiple ways that persistent homology can be generalized.  There 
are two directions of generalization we will discuss.  The first uses more general structures 
on the set of topological spaces being considered and includes zigzag, multidimensional and dag 
persistence.  The second uses alternate topological invariants and includes persistence 
homotopy and persistent knot theory.

<p> Topological measures of similarity (for curves, mostly)</p>

<p>Abstract:

For two curves on a surface, one interesting question is how to quantify how similar the curves are, motivated by applications in GIS data analysis, medical imaging, and computer graphics. Geometric measures such as Hausdorff and Frechet distance are computable, but often not desirable since they do force the deformation to move continuously in the ambient space.  

In this talk, we'll consider measures that instead are based on homotopy or homology.  Such deformations will generally look to minimize some quantity associated with the homotopy or homology, such as total area swept or longest intermediate curve, for example. We will survey several measures which have been introduced and studied in recent years, giving structural properties as well as considering the complexity of the problem or known algorithms to compute it.

<p>Generalized Persistent Homology: Part 2, Why Homology?</p>

<p>Abstract: We will examine multiple ways that persistent homology can be generalized.  There
are two directions of generalization we will discuss.  The first uses more general structures
on the set of topological spaces being considered and includes zigzag, multidimensional and dag
persistence.  The second uses alternate topological invariants and includes persistence
homotopy and persistent knot theory.

<p>Introduction to 3-Manifold Algorithms</p>

Abstract: We will study two fundamental algorithms in 3-manifold topology.  These are the 
unknot recognition (Haken) and sphere recognition problems (Rubinstein/Thompson).  These 
utilize the techniques of normal and almost normal surfaces.  If time permits, computational 
complexity of these algorithm will be discussed.

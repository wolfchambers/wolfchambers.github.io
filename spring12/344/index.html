<h3> Announcements: </h3>
<ul>

<li><p>May 3: <a href="finalreview.pdf">Here</a> is the review sheet for the final review, focusing on the topics covered since the midterm.  Keep in mind programming problems (similar to the homework) are also going to appear on the exam. 

<li><p>April 27: <a href="homework/hw11.pdf">Homework 11</a> is available; it will be due next Friday, May 4, by 11:59pm.

<li><p>April 18: <a href="homework/hw10.pdf">Homework 10</a> is available; it will be due next Wednesday, April 25, by 11:59pm.

<li><p>April 12: As announced in class, your next homework 
assignment will be an essay over the article handed out in class, 
<a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.pdf">Why 
Functional Programming Matters"</a>.  This will be a 1-2 page 
opinion essay, where I would like you to comment on functional 
programming in general, particularly as it relates to your 
experience.  Has learning a functional language changed your 
programming style or views?  Do you feel functional languages are 
better or worse?  Even if you don't continue to use a functional language, is learning one a valuable experience in some way?
<br>
Please begin with a clearly stated thesis statement that concisely 
describes your opinion, and then use examples or information to 
back up your view.  For this paper, you aren't required to 
use other sources, although it may be helpful to do so; in 
particular, there is a lot of good commentary about this article 
on various blogs and in various books.  You are welcome to 
reference or quote any of these works, but please cite all 
sources, as always.

<li><p>Apirl 11: As a clarification of syntax, to start your module (or at least for mine), you can use the following:
<br>
module Sets where 
<br>
import qualified Data.List as L
<br>
data Set a = Set [a]
<br>    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deriving (Show, Eq, Ord)
<br>
-- rest of the functions


<li><p> April 11: Due to pleading requests, I'll grant on extension for 
homework 8.  It will be due by the start of class on Friday, if you would 
like to take an extra day to work on it.

<li><p> April 10: Three minor corrections on the homework.  For the first 
problem, the type of the input function needs to be (a -> a -> b) instead of 
(a -> a -> a).  On the second, you need to import Data.List in order to get 
nub and have list2set compile; I actually did: import qualified Data.List as L, and 
that's why I call L.nub in the code.  Feel free to alter as you prefer, as 
long as it imports those and compiles correctly (or you can remove those 
functions if you don't need them anyway).  Also on the list2set function, the second line should have an =, not ::, since it is declaring the function.

<li><p>April 4: <a href="homework/hw8.pdf">Homework 8</a> is now available; it will be due next Wednesday, April 11, by 11:59pm.

<li><p>March 23: <a href="homework/hw7.pdf">Homework 7</a> is now available; it will be due next Friday, 3/30, by 11:59pm (via email).  Please submit the assignment as a single hs file will all the requested functions included, and remember to compile and test it!

<li><p>March 22: The essay assignment is now due next Monday, 3/26, at the start of class.

<li><p>March 9: Here is a <a 
href=http://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/why-learning-haskell-python-makes-you-a-worse-programmer/">humourous 
note</a> about how learning python and haskell is depressing as a professional programming.  Thought you 
all might appreciate it over the next few weeks of haskell!

<li><p>March 7: <a href="homework/essay6.pdf">Assignment 6</a> is available; this will be a more in-depth essay to investigate a programming language of your choice.  This assignment is due the week after we return from break, on Friday, March 23.

<li><p>March 6: <a href="reviewsolutions.pdf">Here</a> are solutions to review questions from the book, as requested.  

<li><p>March 1: <a href="mt1review.pdf">Here</a> is a review sheet for the midterm.  While long, please don't panic - much of it is just recalling the definitions of the key terms, as well as understanding which languages choose those models.  Please remember to review the homework exercises over these topics as well.

<li><p>Feb. 28: <a href="homework/hw5.pdf">Homework 5</a> is now available;
it will be due next Monday, Feb. 5, at the beginning of class.  

<li><p>Feb. 24: Apologies for the cancellation today; I was stuck at the ER 
again (but with the other kid this time).  Please be sure to read chapter 
7.1 in the textbook.  Look over the review questions at the end of that 
section, since you can expect a quiz over the reading on Monday in class.

<li><p>Feb. 22: There is a typo on the homework; problem 3b should ask for 
the parse tree for abaa, not abab.

<li><p>Feb. 16: <a href="homework/hw4.pdf">Homework 4</a> is now available; 
it will be due next Friday, Feb. 24, at the beginning of class.

<li><p>Feb. 1: <a 
href="http://valis.cs.uiuc.edu/~sariel/teach/notes/373/book.pdf">Here</a> 
is a link to some helpful extra notes on regular expressions and context 
free grammars, if you'd like to see some extra examples.  The proofs are 
beyond the scope of what our class does, but there may still be some 
helpful discussion and examples, if you care to read beyond what the 
book covers.  In particular, see section 2.3 for more DFA examples, 
lecture 5 for NFA examples, lectures 11-12 for more on context free 
grammars and Chomsky Normal form, and lecture 15 for the CYK parsing 
algorithm.

<li><p> Feb. 1: <a href="homework/assignment3.html">Homework 3</a> is 
available; it will be due on Sunday, Feb. 12, by 11:59pm.

<li><p>Jan. 31: I just posted a new pdf of homework 2, which includes 
examples of valid and invalid numbers in C (for problem 1c).  Just click 
on the link in the previous announcement (after reloading your page) in 
order to see the new pdf.

<li><p> Jan. 26: <a href="homework/hw2.pdf">Homework 2</a> is available; 
it will be due next Friday, Feb. 3, at the start of class.  Please 
either submit a paper copy of the entire assignment, or email a pdf of 
it to my email address by the start of class.

<li><p> Jan. 20: <a href="homework/essay1.pdf">The first essay 
assignment</a> is available; it will be due at the start of class next 
Friday, Jan. 27.

<li> <p> Welcome to CS 344!  Please make sure to read the course 
policies carefully, and remember to check this announcements section 
daily for new announcements or reminders.

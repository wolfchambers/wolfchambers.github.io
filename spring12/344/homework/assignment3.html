      The Swedish Chef is a character from Jim Henson's "The Muppet 
Show" that is well known for his comically-extreme Swedish accent.  In a 
similar comical vein, in 1993 John Hagerman wrote a Lex program that 
transforms regular English text into an equivalent version of the text 
as it would be pronounced by the Swedish Chef.  The Lex code for this 
program is <a href="./chef.l">chef.l</a>.
    </P>
    <P>
      The Swedish Chef text converter (along with a few similar 
"linguistic" converters) has also been rendered into an applet by John 
Chambers, which can be found via the following <a 
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/jbc/home/chef.html">link</a>.
    </P>
    <P>
      <b>Your task in this problem</b> is to figure out how this Lex 
program works, and provide comments for each of the rules in the 
translation rules section, describing what English text it converts, and 
what it converts it to.  Be sure to pay attention to the INW and NIW 
start conditions, as these impact when and/or how the subsequent text is 
converted.
    </P>
    <P>
      When you are uncertain how a particular rule works, you can 
experiment with the Swedish Chef converter program to gain better 
understanding as to how/when particular English strings are converted to 
Swedish Chef-isms.  You can do this via the applet, or by compiling the 
chef.l program into an executable via the following Linux commands:
    </P>
    <P>
      <dd><tt>flex chef.l</tt></dd>
      <dd><tt>gcc -o chef lex.yy.c -lfl</tt></dd>

      Text messaging has become a very popular mechanism for communicating over cell phones and the Internet in recent years.  Over time, a shorthand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging">text messaging</a> language (aka "texting"; <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Internet_slang">"Internet slang"</a> is also related) has come to be developed that minimizes the amount of typing individuals have to do in order to communicate their messages.
    </P>
      Some common <i>texting</i> shorthands include:
      <dd><b>lol</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp; "laugh out loud" (or less commonly, "lots of luck")</dd>
      <dd><b>sry</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp; "sorry"</dd>
      <dd><b>plz</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp; "please"</dd>
      <dd><b>b4</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp; "before"</dd>
      <dd>etc.</dd>
    <P>
      A list of common text abbreviations is available under those two links on Wikipedia. 
    </P>
    <P>
      <b>Your task for this problem</b> is to create a Lex program that translates some of these <i>texting</i> shorthands to their full English equivalents.  Please have your program convert at least 20 <i>texting</i> shorthands to their regular English equivalent.  Please avoid offensive or inappropriate terms (i.e.  please don't use "wtf", "omfg", or similar shorthands...).
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Note:</i>  Those of you who are experienced with <i>texting</i> surely know that some <i>texting</i> shorthands, such as "lol", are usually not used to convey their literal translation, but are used more like <a href="">emoticons</a>, which are shorthands that convey emotions.  "Lol" is so commonly used that it is more correctly interpreted as a chuckle (/chuckle) than a loud laugh.  If you wish, you may provide your own interpretations for some of the <i>texting</i> shorthands that fall into this category (but please don't do this for all shorthands;  also be sure to translate some shorthands literally).
    </P>

    <P>
      <b>Your task for this problem</b> is to extend the <i>texting</i> 
converter that you created in Problem #2 to properly perform 
capitalization at the beginning of a sentence.  For example, if the 
<i>texting</i> shorthand "sry" appears at the beginning of a sentence, 
it should be converted to "Sorry", whereas if it appears in the middle 
of a sentence, it will be converted to "sorry".
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Note:</i> You need to have a full understanding of how the 
Swedish Chef converter in Problem #1 works in order to accomplish this 
task.

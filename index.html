<h4>About Me</h4>

I am the Snyder Family Mission Collegiate Professor of Computer Science 
in the <a href="https://cse.nd.edu/"> Department of Computer Science and 
Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a>, 
with a concurrent appointment 
in the <a href="https://acms.nd.edu/">Department of Applied and Computational 
Mathematics and Statistics</a>.  My research is supported in part by 
funding from the National Science Foundation.  I currently serve as 
editor for the <a href="http://jocg.org/index.php/jocg"> Journal of 
Computational Geometry</a> and the <a 
href="https://www.springer.com/mathematics/geometry/journal/41468">Journal 
of Applied and Computational Topology</a>. I also serve on the <a 
href="http://safetoc.org/">SafeToC</a> organizing committee and as an 
advocate, as well as on the board of trustees for the <a 
href="http://computational-geometry.org/society/index.html">Society for 
Computational Geometry</a>.


<p>

I teach theoretical computer science with the occasional math class, and I'm passionate about 
equity and inclusion in computer science and mathematics.  My primary research focus is 
computational topology and geometry, with an increasing focus on topological data analysis, as 
well as a more general interest in combinatorics and combinatorial algorithms.  I like both 
theory and practice, and I am interested both in the limits of computation as well as in 
applications of mathematics to real world data.  Please check my <a 
href="papers/index.html">list of publications</a> for more details about all my past projects 
that span these areas, or see my <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8333-3676">orcid 
profile</a> or my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3JRh4RUAAAAJ&hl=en">google 
scholar profile</a>.

<p>

I'm married to Jeff Chambers, and we have three children, Grace, Edwin, and Jesse. We also have 
two cats named Hercules Mulligan and Natasha Romanoff, and two guinea pigs named Skeletor and 
Squirrel Taco, all of whom are very spoiled. In my spare time, I like to read, build lego 
models, go to concerts and enjoy live music, and drink tea.

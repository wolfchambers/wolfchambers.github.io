<h4>About Me</h4>

I am the Snyder Family Mission Collegiate Professor of Computer Science 
in the <a href="https://cse.nd.edu/"> Department of Computer Science and 
Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a>, 
with a concurrent appointment 
in the <a href="https://acms.nd.edu/">Department of Applied and Computational 
Mathematics and Statistics</a>.  My research is supported in part by 
funding from the National Science Foundation.  I currently serve as 
editor for the <a href="http://jocg.org/index.php/jocg"> Journal of 
Computational Geometry</a> and the <a 
href="https://www.springer.com/mathematics/geometry/journal/41468">Journal 
of Applied and Computational Topology</a>. I also serve on the <a 
href="http://safetoc.org/">SafeToC</a> organizing committee and as an 
advocate, as well as on the board of trustees for the <a 
href="http://computational-geometry.org/society/index.html">Society for 
Computational Geometry</a>.


<p>

I teach computer science with the occasional math class, and research 
problems in computational topology and geometry, as well as 
combinatorics and combinatorial algorithms.  I am also active in 
research projects to support and improve the culture and climate in 
computer science and mathematics, as well as to try to improve broader 
STEM educational experiences at all levels. Please check my <a 
href="papers/index.html">list of publications</a> for more details, or
see my <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8333-3676">orcid profile</a> or my 
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3JRh4RUAAAAJ&hl=en">google scholar
profile</a>.

<p>

I'm married to Jeff Chambers; we have three children, Grace, Edwin, and 
Jesse. We also have two cats named Hercules Mulligan and Natasha 
Romanoff, and two guinea pigs named Skeletor and Squirrel Taco. 
In my spare time, I like to read, build lego models, go to concerts and enjoy live music, 
watch various TV shows (mostly sci-fi and fantasy), and drink tea.

<h3> Announcements: </h3>
<ul>

<li><p>Feb. 17: <a href="homeworks/hw3/hw3.pdf">Homework 3</a> is 
posted.  The due date is next Wednesday, Feb. 25, at the beginning of 
class.

<li><p>Jan 27: <a href="homeworks/hw2/hw2.pdf">Homework 2</a> is posted; 
it will be due Thursday, Feb. 12.  Since it will be graded orally, plan 
to schedule a meeting time with me for that day.  I will bring a sign up 
sheet to class on Monday, Feb. 9 to make those appointments.

<li><p>Jan 24: <a href="homeworks/hw1/hw1.pdf">Homework 1</a> is posted; it 
will be due Monday, February 2, at the beginning of class.

<li><p>Jan 23: I will have an additional office hour each week on 
Tuesday from 2-3pm. 

<li><p> Jan 14:  There is an extension on the due date of HW0; you have 
until 8:50am on Tuesday, January 20, to complete homework 0.  
<br>
I'll also have extra office hours this week on Thursday, from 1-3pm.  If 
you need to arrange for extra office hours at a different time, 
please email me.

<li><p> Jan 14:  I just discovered two typos in homework 0, specifically 
in the recurrences.  They are fixed, and the new version is uploaded, 
but make sure that you download or print the new version after class 
today.

<li><p> Jan 14:  Here is a copy of <a href="cheat.pdf">the theoretical computer science cheat sheet</a>; it contains a lot of handy summations and rules like that Master Theorem which might be useful over the course of the semester.  (Don't panic, though.  You don't need to know all of this; it's just provided as a handy reference of facts and definitions.)

<li> <p> Jan 12: <a href="homeworks/hw0/hw0.pdf">Homework 0</a> is posted; it 
will 
be due Friday in class.  If you 
need a 
refresher on asymptotics, 
please see Ch. 2 in the course textbook or your handy discrete math text.  If you 
need a refresher on recurrences, I recommend <a 
href="http://compgeom.cs.uiuc.edu/~jeffe/teaching/algorithms/notes/x00-recurrences.pdf"> 
these notes</a> as a refresher. 

<li> <p>Jan 9: Welcome to Algorithms!  Please make sure to read the course 
policies 
carefully, and remember to check this announcements section daily for new announcements or reminders.

      <h3><a name="email">Email</a></h3>
      <p> Email contact is perhaps the best way to reach  me with quick questions, although detailed homework questions are better handled in office hours.  I will check email several times throughout the work day, and will also check email once per evening to answer questions and resolve issues.  Email contact over the weekend may be more sporadic, although I will be sure to check at least once.

    Additional articles or online references may be provided throughout the semeseter at the instructor's discretion; please reference the schedule throughout the semester
      for such additions.

    <li> <h3><A name="computercell">Computer and Cell Phone Policy</a></h3>

    <p>You are unlikely to need computer access during lecture, so as a courtesy to both the instructor and the other students, please refrain from using laptops or electronic media during class time.
      </p>

    <p> You are unlikely to need cell phones during the course of lecture.  Please ensure that your cell phone is set to vibrate or silent during lecture, and do not send text messages of any kind.  </p>

<ul>

    <li> <h3><A name="gradedwork">Graded Work</A></H3>
    <ul> 
      <li> Written Homework (30%)
      <P>
      We expect there to be a total of <A href="assignments/">6-8
      written homework assignments</A> during the course.
      At the end of the semester, <b>we will ignore your lowest of the
      homework grades,</b> with the remaining homeworks contributing
      equally to this portion of the grade. 
      </P>

      <P>
      Homeworks will
      generally be due at the beginning of class on the assigned due
      date. Late homeworks will not be accepted without previously given instructor approval!  Students are encouraged to work in groups on harder homework problems, but each student in expected to turn in their own solutions, written completely individually. A good rule of thumb is to be sure that you write your solutions without any notes made while working with other students; this eliminates any chance of copying or academic dishonestly.  A more complete explanation of our
      policy towards <A href="#integrity">Academic Integrity</A> is
      given below.
      </P>

	<p> As discussed <a href="#academicintegrity">below</a>, students are expected
	  to complete assignments using only approved course materials. </p>

	<li> In class quizzes and group work (15%)
	
	<p> On some days, students will be assigned a small set of problems to work on, either individually or in groups.  These assignments will be graded based on good faith efforts; as long as you give a good attempt, you will get full credit.  These will NOT necessarily be announced in advance, but you can expect one every week or two.  </p>

	<p>If you know you will miss class due to a valid excuse, contact the instructor at least 24 hours before to be excused in case there is such an assignment.  Emailing me after the quiz will NOT count as a valid reason; I require some advance notice!  To offset this fairly strong policy, the two lowest grades will be dropped. </p>

	</li>

	<li> Exams (55%)
	        <UL>
	<LI>
	    First Exam (15%):

    </ul> 

    </li>

    <LI> <H3><A name="percentages">Percentages</A></H3>

      <P>
      Letter grades will be based on each students overall
      percentage of awarded points according to the following
      formula.
      </P>
      
      <DL>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 93% will result in a grade of
	    A or better.

	    Student percentage above 90% will result in a grade of
	    A- or better.

	    Student percentage above 87% will result in a grade of
	    B+ or better.

	    Student percentage above 60% will result in a grade of
	    D or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage below 60% will result in a grade of
	    F.
	</DD>
      </DL>Any modification to this scale at the end of the year
      will be <EM>in favor of the students</EM>. That is we may
      later decide to award an A to a student who is slightly
      below the above cutoff, but we certainly will not deny
      an A from someone who is above the cutoff.
  </LI>

  <li> <H3><A name="extracredit">Extra Credit</A></H3>


      <p> Upon occasion (and solely at the instructor's discretion), some
      small extra credit activities may be included, either by announcement
      in class or as part of an assignment.  Please keep in mind that the extra credit is unlikely to significantly affect your grade; if you are concerned about your final grade,  it is much better to focus your energy on the regular assignment.  Extra  credit is solely designed to provide an opportunity to students who wish to explore the topics further. </p>
      

  </li>

  <li> <h3><a name="latehomework">Late Homework</a></h3>

    <p> Late homework or programming assignments will not be accepted.  All homeworks are due at the beginning of the class specified, although other arrangements can be made as needed.
    </p>
      

    <p> In unusual circumstances, such as extreme illness or injury (documented by a doctor's note), 
      family emergencies, etc., please contact the instructor as early as possible to arrange
      accomidations.  </p>

  </li>

  <li> <h3><a name="regrades">Regrade Requests</a></h3>

	<p> I am happy to regrade any assignments, programs, quizzes or exam problems which you think were unfair or incorrect.  Please bring me the original assignment, plus a written explanation of your question or complaint, within <em>two weeks</em> of the time the paper in question is graded and returned to you.

  </li>

  <li> <H3><A name="academicintegrity">Academic Integrity</A></H3>

<p> In the context of this course, I encourage students to discuss general course material, which
includes studying for exams, sharing notes if a student must miss class, and working on any practice
problems which are assigned.  I also encourage you to discuss homework problems with other students, but please be careful to write up all solutions separately and do not copy any material from another student.  As a good rule of thumb, make sure to write your solutions without using any notes or papers written while talking to anyone else (other than possibly the instructor).  Remember, you will be on your own in the exam, so it is in your own best interest to make sure that you really understand the material and can solve each problem on your own!</p>


<p>  Students may <b>not</b> use other sources, including
(but not limited to) websites other than the official course website or those explicitly listed
in course materials, or textbooks other than those officially listed below. </p>

<p> Students who violate academic integrity policies will be reported to the department, particularly if a student plagarizes a website or copies another student's work.  First time
offenses on homework will result in a minimum of a failing grade on the assignment in question, with
egregious or repeated offenses resulting in failure in the course.  In addition, students may be
referred to the College of Arts and Sciences for further disciplinary action.

    <p>The following is a statement of minimum standards for student academic integrity at Saint Louis University; I expect full compliance with the policies described.</p>

<p>The University is a community of learning, whose effectiveness requires an environment of mutual trust and integrity, such as would be expected at a Jesuit, Catholic institution. As members of this community, students, faculty, and staff members share the responsibility to maintain this environment. Academic dishonesty violates it. Although not all forms of academic dishonesty can be listed here, it can be said in general that soliciting, receiving, or providing any unauthorized assistance in the completion of any work submitted toward academic credit is dishonest. It not only violates the mutual trust necessary between faculty and students, but also undermines the validity of the University�s evaluation of students and takes unfair advantage of fellow students.</p>

<p>Further, it is the responsibility of any student who observes such dishonest conduct to call it to the attention of a faculty member or administrator.</p>

<p>Examples of academic dishonesty would be copying from another student, copying from a book or class notes during a closed-book exam, submitting materials authored by or editorially revised by another person but presented as the student�s own work, copying a passage or text directly from a published source without appropriately citing or recognizing that source, taking a test or doing an assignment or other academic work for another student, tampering with another student�s work, securing or supplying in advance a copy of an examination without the knowledge or consent of the instructor, and colluding with another student or students to engage in an act of academic dishonesty.</p>

<p>Where there is clear indication of such dishonesty, a faculty member or administrator has the responsibility to apply appropriate sanctions. Investigations of violations will be conducted in accord with standards and procedures of the school or college through which the course or research is offered. Recommendations of sanctions to be imposed will be made to the dean of the school or college in which the student is enrolled. Possible sanctions for a violation of academic integrity include, but are not limited to, disciplinary probation, suspension, and dismissal from the University. </p>

    <li> <h3><a name="disabilities">Students with Disabilities or Special Needs</a></h3>
    <p>Any student who feels that he or she may need academic accomidations in order to meet the
      requirements of this course, as outlined in the syllabus, due to the presence of a disability, 
      should contact the Student Success Center.  Please call the office at (314)977-8885, send an 
      email to meyerah@slu.edu, or visit the Student Success Center on the 3rd floor of the Busch 
      Student Center.  Confidentiality will be observed in all cases.</p>

    <li><h3><a name="tutoring">Tutoring</a></h3>

      <P>
      Our department employees many junior/senior computer science
      majors to help out in our department labs.  Those students are
      also available to provide assistance with course materials at
      such times.
      </P>

      <P>
      Our department web page maintains a
      <a href="/Dept/labhours.html">current list of the available times and locations</a>.
      </P>

      <P>
      As stated in the <A href="#integrity">Academic Integrity</A> policy,
      these workers are an acceptable resource for help, yet
      you should still document both the source of the help as well as
      the extent, if significant.

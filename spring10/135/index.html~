<h3> Announcements: </h3>
<ul>

<li><p>April 9: <a href="homeworks/hw7.pdf">Homework 7</a> is available; it 
will be due next Friday, April 16.  

<li><p>March 30: The cheat sheet for midterm 2 link has been updated 
with the corrected version of Master Theorem.  Also, there was a bug 
on the homework 6 solutions, in problem 4a, where n4^n should become 
(c4(n)+c5)(4^n).    

<li><p><a href="cheatsheetmt2.pdf">Here</a> is the cheat sheet you 
will be provided for midterm 2.  (If it's missing anything, please contact me ASAP and I'll consider changes.)

<li><p>March 24:  Midterm 2 will be in one week, Wednesday the 31st, during class.  <a href="samplemt2.pdf">Here</a> is a sample midterm covering similar material from a previous incarnation of this course.  While the midterm will focus on material since the last exam (particularly big-O, pseudocode, and recurrences), material from the first part of the course is also possible.

<li><p>March 3:  <a href="homeworks/hw6.pdf">Homework 6</a> is now
posted.  It will be due by the start of class on Friday, March 26.  Please note
that it may be submitted in pairs, if you wish to work with a partner.

<li><p>March 17: I am changing my Thursday office hours for the rest of the semester, since doctors appointments are getting more common now.  I'll keep them on the same day of the week, but instead of 1-2, I'm moving them to 9-10am every Thursday.  (Keep in mind that I'm often around later than that, but I will definitely be in 9-10.)

<li><p> March 4: Just a reminder that my office hours today will not be    
from 1-2 due to a doctor's appointment.  I will be in 11-12 instead if you 
would like to come by, or can arrange another time if you email me.


<li><p>March 3:  <a href="homeworks/hw5.pdf">Homework 5</a> is now
posted.  It will be due by the start of class on Wednesday, March 17.  Please note
that it may be submitted in pairs, if you wish to work with a partner.

<li><p> Feb. 29: I will have to shorten my office hours tomorrow, on 
Monday the 29th, since my daughter is home sick.  I will still be in 
10-11, but will not be able to stay the entire morning in my office.  
Please email me with questions or to make alternate arrangements to 
meet.  

<li><p> Feb. 22: <a href="homeworks/hw4.pdf">Homework 4</a> is now 
posted.
It will be due by the start of class on Monday, March 1.  Please note 
that it
may be submitted in pairs, if you wish to work with a partner.

<li><p>Feb. 15: Apologies for the late notice, but I'll be in late this 
morning due to snow.  I'll reschedule office hours as needed, so please 
email me to 
make arrangements.    

<li><p>Feb. 12:  Midterm 1 will be next Wednesday in class.  <a 
href="practicemidterm1.pdf">Here</a> is a sample midterm; note that the length and/or content may be slightly off from what we've covered, since it is based on a previous version of this course, but it should give you an idea of what to expect on the exam.

<li><p> Feb. 5: <a href="homeworks/hw3.pdf">Homework 3</a> is now posted.
It will be due by the start of class on Friday, Feb. 12.  Please note that it
may be submitted in pairs, if you wish to work with a partner.

<li><p>Jan. 29: I am extending the due date for HW2.  You may have until Tuesday, Feb. 2 to finish it.  You will need to submit it to me <b>in my office before 5pm</b> on Tuesday to recieve full credit.  (If I happen to be out when you stop by, just slide it under my door.)  For those who are almost done with homework 2, I am also giving an <a href="homeworks/hw2extracredit.pdf">extra credit problem</a> that you can work on.

<li><p> Jan. 25: <a href="homeworks/hw2.pdf">Homework 2</a> is now posted.
It will be due by the start of class on Monday, Feb. 1.  Please note that it
may be submitted in pairs, if you wish to work with a partner.

<li><p> Jan. 20: I'll have to leave my office hours a bit early today, 
due to a faculty meeting that was scheduled at 11am.  Instead, I'll 
arrange to be in my office from 12-12:30, after the meeting is over. 

<li><p> Jan. 15: <a href="homeworks/hw1.pdf">Homework 1</a> is now posted.  
It will be due by the start of class on Friday, Jan. 22.  Please note that it 
may be submitted in pairs, if you wish to work with a partner.

posted, for those who want to get an early start.  It will be due by the 
start of class on Friday, Jan. 15.     

<li> <p>Dec. 31: Welcome to Discrete Math!  Please make sure to read the 
course policies  carefully, and remember to check this announcements section daily for new announcements or reminders.

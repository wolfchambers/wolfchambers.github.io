<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate how services are started
and stopped in Linux, and to teach students how to permanently disable
unneeded services on Linux.  Students will start, stop, and disable
services.  Unneeded services can be a potential security risk, so
students should learn how to disable unneeded services in order to
descrease the probability of a security compromise.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>OS hardening is the practice of configuring a machine to make it more
resistant to attack.  Most operating systems ship with many unnecessary
services and applications running.  The more applications and services
that run, the greater the chance is that one or more of them will be
vulnerable to attack.  The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate how to
shut down unnecessary services on Linux.

<span class="anchor" id="terms"></span>

<h2>Terms used in this lab</h2>

<p>Some of the files and folders you'll encounter in this lab are named
confusingly.  The following is a brief introduction to the terms you'll
see:

<dl>
	<dt>xinetd</dt>
	<dd>This is the "Internet super-server".  (The word "inet"
	stands for "internet".)  In the old days, this program was used
	as a front-end to many services.  It's not used as much anymore
	nowadays.  The program than controls xinetd is called
	"chkconfig".</dd>

	<dt>/etc/rc2.d</dt>
	<dd>This directory stores symbolic links (shortcuts) to scripts
	in /etc/init.d/.  In this lab, you'll be renaming files in this
	directory.</dd>

<span class="anchor" id="part1"></span>
<h4>Part 1: Find Running Services</h4>
<ol>
	<li>SSH to nodeA in your experiment.  View the list
	of open ports with the following command:
<pre>$ netstat -t -u -l</pre>
	Netstat is used to show open network connections.  The -t option
	specifies TCP ports, the -u option specifies UDP ports, and the
	-l option specifies only open (or "listening") ports.  Note that
	there are quite a few ports open.
	<li>It would be nice if we knew which programs had those ports
	open.  Netstat's -p option will show the process name that owns
	each open port.  The output will be wide, so maximize the
	terminal window before running the command.  Become root, and
	run the following:
<pre># netstat -t -u -l -p</pre>
This shows the same information as before, except now process names and
IDs are included. Take a screenshot of this window.
</ol>

<p>The interesting columns in the netstat output are Proto, Local
Address, and PID/Program name.  Proto stands for protocol.  It will be
either TCP or UDP (or sometimes TCP6 or UDP6).  Local Address is the IP
address and port that the service is listening on.  The IP address is
usually "*", indicating that the service is listening on all available
network connections.  For some services, the IP address is "localhost"
(or "127.0.0.1"), indicating that the service will accept connections
only from the local machine.   Services that listen on localhost are
generally not a security concern, so we won't bother with those.
PID/Program name gives the process ID and name of the program that is
listening on the port.

<p>The name of the service is generally the same as the name of the
program in the PID/Program name column.  For services controlled by
inetd, the program name will be inetd, and the name of the service will
be found in the Local Address column.

<p>Each of the services that is running represents a potential
opportunity for an intruder to break into the computer (except for the
ones that run only on localhost).  In order to secure the system, it is
necessary to shut down unneeded services.  For this lab, we're going to
shut down all external services except SSH, TFTP, xinetd, rpc.statd, pubsubd, portmap  
and emulab-syncd.  
You need SSH to access the node. TFTP is rarely used and would normally be disabled, but for
this lab we're going to leave it running. The rest of listed services are used
by DeterLab to control or monitor the node.

<p>In Linux, there are multiple ways to start and stop services, and
different distributions offer different tools to manage services.  In
this lab, we'll be using a very low-level method to manage services.
The advantage of this method is that it will work on almost all Linux
distributions, as well as some Unix systems.

<span class="anchor" id="part2"></span>
<h4>Part 2: Shutting Down Services</h4>
<p>Most running services are started or stopped with a script in the
<tt>/etc/init.d</tt> directory.  Usually, the script name will be the
same as the program name, but not always.  To stop a service, run its
script with the argument "stop".  For example, to stop sendmail, run the
following:
<pre>
# /etc/init.d/sendmail stop
</pre>
<p>To start or restart a stopped service, run the script with "start"
instead of "stop".
<pre>
# /etc/init.d/sendmail start
</pre>
<p>To see a list of all the script in that directory, execute the
command "<tt>ls /etc/init.d/</tt>".
<ol>
	<li>In the netstat output from step 2 above, look at the
	"Program name" column.  This will tell you which program to
	stop.
	<li>Go through the list of programs and stop each unnecessary
	service.  (Ignore the services that listen on localhost.)  
	There are a few services whose names don't match the
	script names, but the names are similar, so try to find the
	script names on your own.  If you
	accidentally stop a service you didn't intend to stop, simply
	start it again.
	<li>Run "netstat -t -u -l -p" again and take a screenshot of the
	output.  If all went well, you should have only a few services
	running.  Is TFTP still running?  If not, why not?
	<li>Reboot the virtual machine.  After logging back in, run
	"netstat -t -u -l -p" and observe the results.  What happened to
	the list of open ports? 
</ol>

<span class="anchor" id="part3"></span>
<h4>Part 3: Making it stick</h4>
<p>All of the services you stopped have come back after a reboot.  This is
because Linux starts all configured services at startup.  You stopped
the services, but you didn't change the configuration, so all the
services came back up.  In this part of the lab, we're going to change
the configuration so that the services won't start automatically.

<span class="anchor" id="part3.1"></span>
<h5>Part 3.1: Ordinary Services</h5>
The system determines which services to start based on the default
runlevel.  (For more information on runlevels, see
<a href="http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/Run_Levels">http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/Run_Levels</a>).
In Ubuntu, the default runlevel is 3, so the system services are
controlled by the scripts in <tt>/etc/rc3.d/</tt>.  The name of each script is
the letter S or K, a two-digit number, and the name of the service.  If
a script name starts with an S, the service is Started; if it starts
with a K, it is Killed.  The numbers indicate the order in which the
scripts should be run.  In this part of the lab, you will disable
unneeded services.  

<ol>
	<li>Run "netstat -t -u -l -p" to see which services need to be
	stopped.
	<li>For each service that you stopped earlier, rename its script
	in <tt>/etc/rc3.d</tt> to start with a K instead of an S.  You should
	also change the number after the S.  The new number and the old
	number should add up to 100.  For example,
<pre>
# mv S18sendmail K82sendmail
</pre>
	<li>At this point, you've configured the service to not start on
	boot, but it's still running right now.  After you've renamed a
	script, run it with the "stop" argument to stop the service.
<pre>
# /etc/rc3.d/K82sendmail stop
</pre>
	<li>Write down which scripts you renamed and include the list in
	your lab report.
	<li>Run "netstat -t -u -l -p" to see which services are still
	running.
</ol>
<span class="anchor" id="part3.2"></span>
<h5>Part 3.2: chkconfig</h5>
<p>Some services are run by inetd.  
To ensure they are started or stopped you would need to edit inetd's configuration
file. A Linux tool that can help you manage all the services is called <b>chkconfig</b>

<ol>
	<li>Read about the tool at its <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/chkconfig8.html">Linux man page</a>
	<li>Use the tool to stop the TFTP server at runlevel 3. Now go to <tt>/etc/rc3.d</tt> directory and examine it. What changes do you see?
	<li>Write a small script that would apply your changes from part 3.1 using chkconfig tool. See if you can figure out where it is by using the <tt>locate</tt> command in Linux.
Then swap out your experiment and swap it in again. Run your script and take a screenshot of the output. Submit your script and the screenshot in the lab report. 
</ol>

<span class="anchor" id="glitches"></span>

<div class="level3">
<h3>What can go wrong</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Note that the -p option to netstat requires root privileges.
	If you run "netstat -t -u -l -p", and there are only dashes in
	the "PID/Program name" column, you don't have root privilegs.
	Use "sudo" to run as root.
	<li>One common issue is students being unable to find the
	scripts that control certain services.  First, remember that
	services that listen only on localhost or 127.0.0.1 can be
	ignored for this exercise.  Secondly, the name of the script
	doesn't always exactly match the name of the service.  However,
	the names always resemble each other.  
        <li>If you kill a service that needed to stay on you may fail to log 
         onto your node or may need to input a password on each login. To 
         fix this problem swap out your experiment and swap in again. You will
         need to redo the lab from the start.

	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Security-Principles-William-Stallings/dp/0136004245/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1295927973&sr=8-1">Computer Security: Principles and Practice</a>, by Stallings and Brown

	<p>Note that this textbook is not required.  Computer security is a fast moving area, and I will heavily use internet resources, so a number of successful students have opted to not purchase the text and done fine.  However, if you would like an extra resource or anticipate missing any class, this book is the one that I base many of my lectures on, although I deviate heavily from it in order to pull in additional information.


    </LI>

    <li>
      <h3><a name="email">Email</a></h3>
      <p> Email contact with the course instructor is a necessity in this class..  I will check email several times throughout the work day, and will also
      check email once per evening to answer questions and resolve issues.  Email contact over the weekend may be more sporadic, although I will be sure to check at least once.
      </p>
    </li>

    <LI><h3><A name="additionalmaterial">Additional Material</a></h3>
    Additional articles or online references will be provided throughout the semeseter; please reference the schedule throughout the semester
      for such additions.
    </li>

    <li> <h3><A name="computercell">Computer and Cell Phone Policy</a></h3>

    <p> Computers will be an integral part of this course, both inside and
      outside of class.  However, out of courtesy to both the instructor and
      other students, please do not use the lab computers for non-class
      related activity.  In particular, you do not need to be using a computer
      unless an exercise or in class activity requiring them is in progress.
      </p>

    <p> You are unlikely to need cell phones during the course of lecture.  Please ensure that 
your cell phone is set to vibrate or silent during lecture, and do not send text messages of any 
kind.  </p>

<ul>

    <li> <h3><A name="gradedwork">Graded Work</A></H3>
    <ul> 
    
      <li>Attendance and quizzes (5%)
      
      <p> A portion of your grade will be based on in class participation or
 pop quizzes given in lecture.  These are entirely at the 
instructors discretion.  If you expect to miss class due to illness, 
weather, or any other reason, it is your responsibility to notify the 
instructor before class begins.
      
      </li>
      
      <li> Written Homework (20%)

	<p> There will be a series of written homeworks and essay 
assignments in the class, which (in total) will compromise 20% of your 
final score.  Essays will be over papers assigned in class.  Each will 
be 1-2 pages long, and should both summarize key points and 
take an opinion on the article.  

      </li>
     
      <li>Labs (40%)
      
	<p>There will be several labs on computer security.  Each will 
be done on the DETER system, a remove cluster where our virtual 
machines will be running.  Each lab will be self contained, and must 
be done individually.  Stay tuned for more information on the DETER 
system as well as on our assignments.

      </li>

	<li> Exams (35%)

	<p> There will be two exams, a midterm and a cumulative final, 
worth 15% and 20% of your total grade (respectively).  The midterm will be the week 
before spring break (unless we have any major schedule changes), and 
the final is set to be on Tuesday, December 13 at 8am.

	</LI>

    </ul> 

    </li>

    <LI> <H3><A name="percentages">Percentages</A></H3>

      <P>
      Letter grades will be based on each students overall
      percentage of awarded points according to the following
      formula.
      </P>
      
      <DL>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 93% will result in a grade of
	    A or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 90% will result in a grade of
	    A- or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 87% will result in a grade of
	    B+ or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 83% will result in a grade of
	    B or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 80% will result in a grade of
	    B- or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 77% will result in a grade of
	    C+ or better.

	    C- or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 60% will result in a grade of
	    D or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage below 60% will result in a grade of
	    F.
	</DD>
      </DL>Any modification to this scale at the end of the year
      will be <EM>in favor of the students</EM>. That is we may
      later decide to award an A to a student who is slightly
      below the above cutoff, but we certainly will not deny
      an A from someone who is above the cutoff.
  </LI>


  <li> <h3><a name="latehomework">Late Homework</a></h3>

	<p> Due to the fact that labs are through a new system (and 
the fact that we all have busy lives), I'll grant a 3 day extension on 
any homework or lab as long as you email me to request it BEFORE the 
assignment is due.  The only exception will be homework or exercises 
which I specify will need to be done by a certain class period, as 
those will generally be used in our exercises for that day (and hence 
need to be completed by the start of class in order for you to recieve 
credit).

	<p> Extensions for more than 3 days will require some form of 
medical documentation or an excuse from a dean.

  </li>

  <li> <h3><a name="regrades">Regrade Requests</a></h3>

	<p> I am happy to regrade any assignments, programs, quizzes or exam problems which you 
think were unfair or incorrect.  Please bring me the original assignment, plus a written 
explanation of your question or complaint, within <em>two weeks</em> of the time the paper in 
question is graded and returned to you.

  </li>

  <li> <H3><A name="academicintegrity">Academic Integrity</A></H3>

<p> In the context of this course, I encourage students to discuss general course material, which
includes studying for exams, sharing notes if a student must miss class, and working on any practice
problems which are assigned.  We will also have occasional programming assignments that will be 
completed in pairs.  However, unless clearly stated otherwise in the assignment description, 
any work which will be submitted for a grade must
be completed by individuals.  

<p> This course is somewhat different in that you are welcome to use <b>any</b> source of 
information, as long as you clearly document the source if you directly reference or 
copy anything.  In fact, I will expect a high degree of independent research, so get used to
using google to find relevant resources!  However, I will ask for a degree of common sense;
if you post a question to a homework help site and I discover that you are not doing the actual 
homework yourself, you will be considered in violation of the academic integrity policy.  
Likewise, copying from another student will be met with strict penalties, since the labs 
are where you will learn most of the  material.  If you have any questions or concerns about 
a particluar situation as it arises, feel free to contact me directly for clarification.

<p> Students who violate academic integrity policies will be reported to the 
department.  First time offenses on homework will result in a minimum of a failing 
grade on the assignment in question, with egregious or repeated offenses resulting in 
failure in the course.  In addition, students will be referred to the College of Arts 
and Sciences for further disciplinary action.

    <p>The following is a statement of minimum standards for student academic integrity 
at Saint Louis University; I expect full compliance with the policies described.</p>


<p>Academic integrity is honest, truthful and responsible conduct in all academic endeavors. The mission of Saint Louis University is "the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity."  Accordingly, all acts of falsehood demean and compromise the corporate endeavors of teaching, research, health care, and community service via which SLU embodies its mission. The University strives to prepare students for lives of personal and professional integrity, and therefore regards all breaches of academic integrity as matters of serious concern.
 
<p>The governing University-level Academic Integrity Policy was adopted in Spring 2015, and can be accessed on the Provost's Office website at:http://www.slu.edu/Documents/provost/academic_affairs/University-wide%20Academic%20Integrity%20Policy%20FINAL%20%206-26-15.pdf. 
 
<p>Additionally, each SLU College, School, and Center has adopted its own academic integrity policies, available on their respective websites.  All SLU students are expected to know and abide by these policies, which detail definitions of violations, processes for reporting violations, sanctions, and appeals.  Please direct questions about any facet of academic integrity to your faculty, the chair of the department of your academic program, or the Dean/Director of the College, School or Center in which your program is housed.

    <li> <h3><a name="disabilities">Students with Disabilities or Special 
Needs</a></h3> In recognition that people learn in a variety of ways and that learning 
is influenced by multiple factors (e.g., prior experience, study skills, learning 
disability), resources to support student success are available on campus. Students who 
think they might benefit from these resources can find out more about:
<ul>
<li>Course-level support (e.g., faculty member, departmental resources, etc.) by asking 
your course instructor. 
<li>University-level support (e.g., tutoring/writing services, 
Disability Services) by visiting the Student Success Center (BSC 331) or by going to 
www.slu.edu/success. 
</ul>
Students who believe that, due to a disability, they could benefit 
from academic accommodations are encouraged to contact Disability Services at 
314-977-3484 or to visit the Student Success Center. Confidentiality will be observed 
in all inquiries. Course instructors support student accommodation requests when an 
approved letter from Disability Services has been received and when students discuss 
these accommodations with the instructor after receipt of the approved letter.
    </li>


<li> <h3> <a name="title9">Title IX Information</a></h3>

Saint Louis University and its faculty are committed to supporting our students and seeking an 
environment that is free of bias, discrimination, and harassment. If you have encountered any form 
of sexual misconduct (e.g. sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, domestic or dating 
violence), we encourage you to report this to the University. If you speak with a faculty member 
about an incident of misconduct, that faculty member must notify SLU’s Title IX coordinator, Anna 
R. Kratky (DuBourg Hall, room 36;akratky@slu.edu; 314-977-3886) and share the basic facts of your 
experience with her. The Title IX coordinator will then be available to assist you in understanding 
all of your options and in connecting you with all possible resources on and off campus.
 
<p>If you wish to speak with a confidential source, you may contact the counselors at the University 
Counseling Center at 314-977-TALK. To view SLU’s sexual misconduct policy and for resources, please

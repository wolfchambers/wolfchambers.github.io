<H1>Overview</H1>

<P> As you may have noticed, the vector class in C++ has much less 
functionality than the list class in Python.  In addition, we did not even 
complete all of the vector functionality that is included in the standard 
template library.</p>

<p> In as effort to ``upgrade" the vector class we wrote, you will write the 
following functions described below in our Vector.h file.  (Please download 
Vector.h from the course schedule webpage and insert your functions into 
this class, then submit the entire Vector.h file via email by the due date.) 
</P>

<H1>Functions to code</h1>


  
  <li> void remove(Object val);
  
  <p>Removes the earlist occurance of val present in the vector.  Note that 
this changes the size.
  
  </li>
  
  <li>
  void reverse();
  
<p> Reverses the order of the vector's elements.

  </li>
  
    <li>
  bool operator<(const Vector<Object>& other);
  
  <p>Returns true if the contents of the current vector are lexicographically 
less than the contents of other.  Note that this function ignores the capacity of the 
vectors, and only compares the elements that are actually in the vector.

  <p>Note: Be careful of exceeding the capcity of each vector!  You should 
be careful not to run off the end of the array, and only compare the vectors 
up to the smaller one's size.

  </li>


   <li>void replace(const Object& val1, const Object& val2);
   
   <p> Replace all instances of val1 in the vector with the value val2.  
Note that this should not just find the first such position, but should 
replace every instance. </p>
   </li>

</UL>

<h1>Extra Credit</h1>


<li>void resize ( int sz, Object c );

<p>Resizes the vector to contain sz elements.

<p>If sz is smaller than the current vector size, the content is reduced to its first sz elements, the rest being dropped.

<p>If sz is greater than the current vector size, the content is expanded by inserting at the end as many copies of c as needed to reach a size of sz elements. This may cause a reallocation.

<p>Notice that this function changes the actual content of the vector by inserting or erasing elements from the vector; it does not only change its storage capacity.
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Testing</h1>

You are also required to write a test file, similar to our testVector.cpp in class.  You our welcome to use our code from class as a starting point, but your grade will be partially based on how well you test your code.  Remember to thoroughly test all possible inputs before submitting.

<hr>

<h1>Analysis</h1>

In addition, your readme file must include a worst case runtime analysis (with a big-O bound) for each function that you code.

<P> The assignment is worth <em>10</em> points. One point will be based on 
a checkpoint with the instructor on Thursday, October 11, at which time you will be 
expected to have completed at least 20 lines of code for the assignment.  
The remaining 9 points will be based on your implementation, test file, and readme. </P>

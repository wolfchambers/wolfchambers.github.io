<li><p> 

<li><p> Nov. 20: The <a href="homeworks/FinalProject.pdf">final project assignment</a> is now posted.  Please read it over the break, and submit your plan for what you would like to do to me via email by next Wednesday, Nov. 28.  I'm also happy to discuss during office hours next week, if you have other ideas for a project or further questions.

<li><p> Nov. 11: <a href="homeworks/hw5.pdf">Homework 5</a> is now available; it will be due the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, on Nov. 27, at the start of class.

<li><p> Nov. 10: <a href="homeworks/essay3.pdf">Essay 3</a> is now available.  As described in class, it asks you to find a use of clutering in bioinformatics research, and analyze that component of the paper/work.  It will be due the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, on Nov. 20.  (If you will miss this class, you are welcome to submit early or email me a pdf of your essay.)

<li><p> Oct. 30: <a href="homeworks/hw4.pdf">Homework 4</a> is now available; it will be due by Tuesday, Nov. 13, at the start of class. 

<li><p> Oct. 11: <a href="homeworks/essay2.pdf">Essay 2</a> is now available.  This will be your focus for next week and over break (instead of a homework), and will be due after fall break, on Thursday, Oct. 25.

<li><p> Sept. 20: <a href="homeworks/hw3.pdf">Homework 3</a> is now available; it will be due on Tuesday, Oc. 16, at the start of class.

<li><p> Sept. 10: <a href="homeworks/hw1.pdf">Homework 1</a> is now available; it will be due next Tuesday, September 18, at the start of class.  I'd prefer this one be handed in on paper, if possible, but can take electronic pdf submissions as well, if you prefer that method.

<li><p> Aug. 30: Note that <a href="homeworks/essay1.pdf">the first essay assignment</a> has been posted on the homework page; it will be due at the start of class next Thursday.  Please bring a 1-2 page typed copy to class, or email me a pdf before the start of class that day.

<li><p>Aug. 24: We will keep the course meeting time as Tuesday/Thursday at 2:15pm, in Ritter 106, since there is no longer a conflict with this time.

<li> <p>Aug. 24: Welcome to Bioinformatics Algorithms!  Please make sure to read the course policies carefully, and remember to check this 
announcements section regularly for new announcements or reminders.

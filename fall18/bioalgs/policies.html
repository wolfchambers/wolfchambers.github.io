    <li>
	<h3><A name="#textbook">Textbook and reference materials</A></h3>
	
<p> The primary text for this class will be <a 
href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-bioinformatics-algorithms">An Introduction to 
Bioinformatics Algorithms</a>, by Neil C. Jones and Pavel A. Pevzner.

<p>In addition, we will use lecture notes by Ben Langmead, available on his <a 
href="http://www.langmead-lab.org/teaching-materials/">teaching materials</a> page.  

<p>I will post 
references in the schedule dailty with pointers to the source material, either from these two 
sources or (occasionally) from some other reference.

     </li>

    <li>
      <h3><a name="email">Email</a></h3>
      <p> 

Outside of office hours and lectures, email is usually the easiest way to get ahold of me with 
questions.  I will check email several times throughout the work day, and will also check email 
once per evening to answer questions and resolve issues.  Email contact over the weekend will 
likely be more sporadic, although I will be sure to check at least once.

      </p>
    </li>




    <li> <h3><A name="computercell">Computer and Cell Phone Policy</a></h3>

    <p> Laptops and other electronic devices are unnecessary for most of this course, and are frequently a distraction to other students in lecture.  Since you are unlikely to need a computer during lecture, please do not bring laptops or other electronics for use in class.  
      </p>

    <p> Also, please ensure that your cell phone is set to vibrate or silent during lecture, and do not send text messages of any kind.  </p>
    </ul>

<ul>

    <li> <h3><A name="gradedwork">Graded Work</A></H3>
    <ul> 
      <li> Problem sets (40%)
	<p> There will be homework due regularly throughout the semester, with a total (roughly) 8 problems sets.
Most will be written problem sets, due on paper at the start of class.
	</p>

	<p> For all homeworks, you are allowed to required to submit individual solutions.
However, I encourage all of you to work with another student, as the best 
way to learn this material is to discuss and problem solve in a small group.
Verbatim copying (from another student or from the internet) is forbidden, so please be sure to 
write up your solutions on your own.  (A good rule of thumb is to take notes when working in a group, but then
write them up later solo without the notes, and just reference the notes if you forget any details.)
</p>

	<li> Essays and other written assignments (20%)

	<p> In addition to problem sets, I will also have essay assignments throughout the semester.  Typically these will 
be 1-2 pages papers, often asking you to summarize a paper or describe some reading that goes beyond course material.  
These will be due on paper, at the start of class.

	<li> Exams (40%)
	        <UL>
	<LI>
	    Midterm (15%): TBD
	</LI>
	<LI>
	    Final Exam (25%): Thursday, Dec. 13, at 2pm

    </ul> 

    </li>

    <LI> <H3><A name="percentages">Percentages</A></H3>

      <P>
      Letter grades will be based on each students overall
      percentage of awarded points according to the following
      formula.
      </P>
      
      <DL>

	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 90% will result in a grade of
	    A or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 87% will result in a grade of
	    A- or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 83% will result in a grade of
	    B+ or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>

	    Student percentage above 80% will result in a grade of
	    B or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 77% will result in a grade of
	    B- or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 73% will result in a grade of
	    C+ or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 70% will result in a grade of
	    C or better.
	</DD>

	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 67% will result in a grade of
	    C- or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 60% will result in a grade of
	    D or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage below 60% will result in a grade of
	    F.
	</DD>
      </DL>

      <p>Any modification to this scale at the end of the year
      will be <EM>in favor of the students</EM>. That is we may
      later decide to award an A to a student who is slightly
      below the cutoff, but we certainly will not deny
      an A from someone who is above the cutoff. </p>

      <p> No matter what curve I impose, I maintain that the minimum passing grade for this class is a 50% - so if your average is lower than that, you will fail this class.</p>
  </LI>

  <li> <H3><A name="extracredit">Extra Credit</A></H3>

      <P>In general, extra credit will not be assigned in this class.  The 
      homework assignments provided will be challenging enough
      for everyone, so I would like for students to focus on the 
      assignments provided. 
      </P>

      <p> Upon occasion (and solely at the instructor's discretion), some
      small extra credit activities may be included, either by announcement
      in class or as part of an assignment.  Please keep in mind that the extra credit is unlikely to
      significantly affect your grade; if you are concerned about your final grade, 
      it is much better to focus your energy on the regular assignment.  Extra 
      credit is solely designed to provide an opportunity to students who wish to 
      explore the topics further. </p>
      

  </li>

  <li> <h3><a name="latehomework">Late Homework</a></h3>

    <p> Late homework will suffer a penalty of 10% for every hour they are late. For example, homework which is submitted one hour late is worth at most 90% of the total credit.
    </p>
      

    <p> In unusual circumstances, such as extreme illness or injury (documented by a doctor's note), 
      family emergencies, etc., please contact the instructor as early as possible to arrange
      accomidations.  </p>

  </li>

  <li> <h3><a name="regrades">Regrade Requests</a></h3>

	<p> I am happy to regrade any assignmentss or exam problems which you think were unfair or 
incorrect.  Please bring me the original assignment, plus a written explanation of your question 
or complaint, within <em>two weeks</em> of the time the paper in question is graded and returned 
to you.

  </li>

  <li> <H3><A name="academicintegrity">Academic Integrity</A></H3>

<p> In the context of this course, I encourage students to discuss general course material, which 
includes studying for exams, sharing notes if a student must miss class, and working on any 
practice problems which are assigned.  You are also allowed to turn in homework assignments in 
pairs.  I also encourage you to discuss problems with other students, but please be careful to 
write up all solutions separately and do not copy any material from another student.  As a good 
rule of thumb, make sure to write your solutions without using any notes or papers written while 
talking to anyone other than your partner.  Remember, you will be on your own in the exam, so it 
is in your own best interest to make sure that you really understand the material and can solve 
each problem on your own!</p>

<p> You are allowed to use outside sources of information in this class, including 
textbooks and webpages.  If the complete and correct answer is on page 263 of the lecture 
notes, the best solution you can submit is "See page 263 of the lecture notes." Period.  
However, if you find a solution from any other source, such as a web page, a journal 
paper, a different algorithms textbook, or your mom, <b>you must rewrite the solution in 
your own words, and you must properly cite your sources</b>. Assume the grader has access 
to all the official course material, but nothing else. While we strongly encourge you to 
use any outside source at your disposal, please remember that the homework is supposed to 
demonstrate that you understand of the material, not just how to use Google. (In particular,
if you blindly copy an incorrect solution, don't expect to get very many points for it!) </p>


<p> Students who violate academic integrity policies will be reported to the department, particularly in cases where relevant sources are not cited or in cases of direct copying of another student's work.  First time
offenses on homework will result in a minimum of a failing grade on the assignment in question, with
egregious or repeated offenses resulting in failure in the course.  In addition, students may be
referred to the College of Arts and Sciences for further disciplinary action.

    <p>A statement of minimum standards for student academic integrity at Saint Louis University is described <a href="https://www.slu.edu/arts-and-sciences/faculty-resources/syllabi-statements.php">here</a>; I 
expect full compliance with the policies described.</p>

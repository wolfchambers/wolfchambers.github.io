<h3> Announcements: </h3>
<ul>

<li><p>Sept. 12: There is a bug on homework 2.  On problem 1, part b, the first line should read: 
<br>*b = 'U';
<br>
rather than b = 'U';.  Please correct the mistake or at least note that it would case an error and describe why that error would happen as written.

<li><p>Sept. 8: <a href="homework/hw2.pdf">Homework 2</a> is available; it will be due on Monday, Sept. 16, by 11:59pm.  Note that you are also welcome to submit the written paper portion in class that morning, if you prefer, rather than submitting via email.

<li><p>Aug. 29: <a href="homework/hw1.pdf">Homework 1</a> is available; it will be due next Saturday, Sept. 7, by 11:59pm.  Note that this homework must be completed individually.

<li><p> Aug. 28: Note that we will have a normal lecture tomorrow (Thursday), and the lab will be on Friday this week.  (In general, labs will always be on Thursdays for the rest of the semester unless otherwise specifically announced.)

<li><p> Aug. 28: <a href="http://cs.slu.edu/~goldwasser/publications/python2cpp.pdf">Here</a> is the link to the transition guide from Python to C++; our lectures will be largely based on this document for the first few weeks of class.

<li><p> August 20: Welcome to CS180!  Please be sure to read course policies
carefully, and check this page daily for updates or announcements.

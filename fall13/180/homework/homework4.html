<H1><A NAME="overview">Overview</A></H1>

<P>
We have emphasized the importance of a class's "housekeeping"
functions (the copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor).
At times we have differentiated between the
default behaviors provided by C++ which perform what is known as a
<em>shallow copy</em>, and our own implementation for providing what is
known as a <em>deep copy</em>.
</P>

<P>
As an example, 
we gave a linked-list implementation of a stack
in an earlier lecture.   If we do not explicitly provide non-trivial
housekeeping functions, the default copy constructor produces a
shallow copy as portrayed in the following figure.
</p>
<p>
<img src="figures/2simple.gif">
</p>
<p>
Such an image of a shallow copy should sound a warning for
an experienced C++ programmer, as the two stacks do not seem to have
independent state.   Interestingly, in the case of a stack, things are
not quite as bad as they seem.
For example, if we make a call to <tt>s.push('E')</tt> using the original
implementation, we get the following internal configuration.
</p>
<p>
<img src="figures/3simple.gif">
</p>
<p>
Yet this is not necessarily a disaster.  From the perspective of
<tt>s</tt> we seem to have a linked list of five elements, and from
the perspective of <tt>t</tt> we seem to have a linked list of four
elements.
</p>
<p>
If we were to continue with a call to <tt>t.pop()</tt> from this
point, we would set
<nobr><tt>tp = tp-&gt;next</tt></nobr> and decrement
<tt>sz</tt> leading to the following state.
</p>
<p>
<img src="figures/4simple.gif">
</p>

<p>
We do not yet have a disaster on our hands.   In fact, if we used the
original <tt>LinkedStack</tt> class with the default housekeeping functions,
there are only two potential flaws with the entangled states.
<ul>
  <li>
      <p>
      The original version offered both a const and a non-const
      version of <tt>top()</tt>.  The non-const version is a problem
      because it allows one to overwrite the data at the top of the
      stack.  If we were to do <nobr><tt>t.top() = 'X'</tt></nobr> at
      this point, that would not only change the state of
      stack&nbsp;<tt>t</tt> but implicitly the state of stack&nbsp;<tt>s</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
      To remedy this problem, we have chosen to remove the non-const
      version of <tt>top()</tt>.  See the extra credit challenge if
      you would like to support this behavior. 
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      The <tt>pop</tt> method was originally implemented as follows.
<tt>
<pre>
  void pop()  {
    if (empty())
      throw std::runtime_error("Access to empty stack");
    Node* old = tp;                         // node to remove
    tp = tp->next;
    sz--;
    delete old;
  }
</pre>      
</tt>
      The pitfall here is the deletion of <tt>old</tt>.  When a
      stack is guaranteed to have its own independent linked list,
      this step is important for avoiding a memory leak.  If that were
      not done, the node known as <tt>old</tt> would be forever
      lost yet not deallocated.  But if you look back at the previous
      figures, such a call to <tt>t.pop()</tt> would inadvertently
      free the node containing 'D', thereby invalidating the state of
      stack&nbsp;<tt>s</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
      One remedy for this problem is simply to get rid of the command
      <tt>delete old</tt>.   With that change, our public abstraction of
      a stack is valid.  Even though we have used a shallow copy, we
      can subsequently manipulate both stacks independently without
      undesired side effects.  The problem with this remedy
      is that our program has a huge memory leak, as nodes are created
      but never destroyed.  In the next section, we describe a
      strategy for avoiding the memory leak.
      </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<H1><A NAME="refs">Maintaining Reference Counts</A></H1>

<P>
The challenge we face is that sometimes when popping an item or
deallocating a stack we need to delete a node, yet other times we need
to leave such a node in memory because it is still part of a list for
another stack.  Our solution is to explicitly maintain a <em>reference
count</em> for each node in the system.  The reference count for a
node is the number of live pointers that reference that node.
Whenever a pointer is assigned to that node, the node's reference
count should be incremented.  Whenever a pointer to the node is
reassigned elsewhere or outright destroyed, we decrement the node's
reference count.  When a node's reference count reaches zero it can
safely be deleted as it is unreachable.
</P>

<HR>

<H1><A NAME="task">Your Task</A></H1>

<p>
Your goal is to implement a stack class that creates shallow copies
for the copy constructor and assignment operator, with the use of
reference counting for deleting unused nodes.
We will start you off with a working implementation of the stack class
that creates deep copies. 
</p>

<p>
For accounting purposes, the code we provide manages an additional
variable <tt>SmartStack::total</tt> that counts the overall number of nodes in the
system.  <em>Please do not confuse this variable with the above
mentioned reference counting.</em>  The <tt>total</tt> variable is a
single static variable, meaning that it is not part of an individual
node's state but instead shared globally throughout the program.
In order to keep an accurate count of the number of nodes,
we execute <tt>total++</tt>
inside the <tt>Node</tt> class constructor and <tt>total--</tt> within
the <tt>Node</tt> class destructor.  Although you are welcome to make
changes to those routines, please do not alter our management of the
<tt>total</tt> variable.

<H1><A NAME="debug">Debugging Your Program</A></H1>

<p>
We offer the above example to demonstrate many of the complexities
that arise for smart stacks.  However, succeeding on this one example
does not guarantee that your code is valid for all scenarios.  You are
responsible for thoroughly testing your own program, and we will
certainly be running many additional tests when grading.

<p>
Also, please note that the <tt>dump</tt> method we have provided is
used to print the element values in the underlying linked list.  We
strongly recommend having you change that method to include output for
the reference counts as well, to provide you a more detailed
behind-the-scene glimpse at the state of your stacks.

      <TT>smart_stack.h</TT>
      <BR>
      This is the implementation of the stack using traditional house
      keeping functions that perform a deep copy.  It is based upon
      the version that we examined in an earlier lecture, although we
      have nodes explicitly declared in the stack class here rather than
      using the SLinkedList class as a private value.  We also
      have added a bit of debugging code to the <tt>Node</tt> class to
      keep track of the total number of nodes that currently exist in
      the system.
      <p>
      Note:  For the sake of simplicity, we did not bother to separate
      out the function bodies for the class into a separate
      "smart_stack.cpp" file.  All the function bodies are embeded
      directly into the header.  You should make your changes directly
      to the .h file as well.

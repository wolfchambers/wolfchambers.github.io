<H1>Overview</H1>

<P> As you may have noticed, the vector class in C++ has much less 
functionality than the list class in Python.  In addition, we did not even 
complete all of the vector functionality that is included in the standard 
template library.</p>

<p> In as effort to ``upgrade" the vector class we wrote, you will write the 
following functions described below in our Vector.h file.  (Please download 
Vector.h from the course schedule webpage and insert your functions into 
this class, then submit the entire Vector.h file via email by the due date.) 
</P>

<H1>Functions to code</h1>

<ul>
  <li> void remove(Object val);
  
  <p>Removes the earlist occurance of val present in the vector.  Note that this 
changes the size.
  
  
<li>  void erase(int index);
  
  <p>This is actually the same as our current erase function, expect for one 
difference.  You will rewrite the function erase from our implementation of 
vectors so that if the number of elements gets below capacity/4, you shrink the 
array size by half. If this happens, all the elements copied into a new array of 
the appropriate size.
  
<li> bool operator==(const Vector<Object>& other);
  
  <p>Returns true if the contents of the vector are pairwise identical, and false 
otherwise.  Note that this function ignores the capacity of the vectors, and only 
compares the elements that are actually in the vector.</p>
  
</ul>

<h1>Extra Credit</h1>

<ul>
  <LI>
void resize ( int sz, Object c );

<p>Resizes the vector to contain sz elements.

<p>If sz is smaller than the current vector size, the content is reduced to its first sz elements, the rest being dropped.

<p>If sz is greater than the current vector size, the content is expanded by inserting at the end as many copies of c as needed to reach a size of sz elements. This may cause a reallocation.

<p>Notice that this function changes the actual content of the vector by inserting or erasing elements from the vector; it does not only change its storage capacity. 
  

</ul>

<h1>Testing</h1>

You are also required to write a test file, similar to our testVector.cpp in class.  You our welcome to use our code from class as a starting point, but your grade will be partially based on how well you test your code.  Remember to thoroughly test all possible inputs before submitting.

<hr>

<h1>Analysis</h1>

In addition, your readme file must include a worst case runtime analysis (with a big-O bound) for each function that you code.

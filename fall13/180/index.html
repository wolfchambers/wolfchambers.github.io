<h3> Announcements: </h3>
<ul>

<li><p>Dec. 5: The review session is currently set for Friday, Dec. 13, 
at 2pm.  (Email me in the next day or so if you have a conflict but did 
not note it during class today.)

<li><p>Dec. 4: Class and office hours are canceled for tomorrow, Thursday Dec. 5th.  We will have class on Friday as usual, as well as as make-up office hours from 8:30-10am that morning.

<li><p>Dec. 2: <a href="homework/hw11.pdf">Homework 11</a> is available; it will be due on the final day of class, at the start of lecture.

<li><p>Nov. 13: Please re-download the <a href="schedule/BinaryTree.h">BinaryTree.h</a> file, as I think this was the source of the issues a few students reported.  If issues persist, contact me ASAP.  Also, if you wind up needing an extra day to finish this off due to the error in my code, just let me know and I'm happy to accomodate.  

<li><p>Nov. 12: <a href="homework/homework10.html">Homework 10</a> is posted.  This homework will have a checkpoint due Monday, Nov. 25, at which point you must be able to show me at least 30 lines of code.  (This is intended to make sure you start early and ask about any issues that arise as soon as possible!)  The final code is due on Monday, Dec. 2.  You may work with a partner on this assignment.

<li><p>Nov. 6: The second midterm will be on Monday, Nov. 18; there will be a review session in class the Friday before.  It will cover everything up through AVL trees (so up to homework 9).

<li><p>Nov. 6: <a href="homework/homework9.html">Homework 9</a> is available; it will be due next Thursday.  Please note that you may work with a partner on this assignment.

<li><p>Oct. 30: <a href="homework/homework8.html">Homework 8</a> is available; it will be due next Thursday, Nov. 7, at 11:59pm.

<li><p>Oct. 24: <a href="homework/hw7.pdf">Homework 7</a> is available; it must be done individually, and will be due next Friday at the start of class.  You may submit either electronically or on paper.  

<li><p>Oct. 24: As announced in class, please note that office hours today are moved to 11am (instead of 9am).  Email me if this causes any scheduling issues, and we can work out another time to meet.  Also as announced in class, the redo for your lowest problem on the midterm is due tomorrow (Friday) at the start of class; you must submit both the original midterm and the corrected solution to a problem in person at the start of class.

<li><p>Oct. 8: <a href="homework/homework6.html">Homework 6</a> is available; it will be due on Wednesday, Oct. 23, by midnight.  Note that you must work alone for this program.

<li><p>Sept. 30: The first midterm will be next Friday, Oct. 11, during class.  There will be a review session for the midterm in class on October 10; as a result, there is no lab next week (although we'll still have lab as usual this Thursday).

<li><p>Sept. 30: <a href="homework/homework5.html">Homework 5</a> is available; it will be due next Monday, Oct. 7.

<li><p>Sept. 21: <a href="homework/homework4.html">Homework 4</a> is available; it will be due Tuesday, Oct. 2, by 11:59pm.  Note that you are welcome to work with a partner on this assignment and submit a single version of the program.

<li><p>Sept. 16: <a href="homework/hw3.pdf">Homework 3</a> is available; it will be due next Monday, Sept. 23, by 11:59pm (via email).

<li><p>Sept. 12: There is a bug on homework 2.  On problem 1, part b, the first line should read: 
<br>*b = 'U';
<br>
(rather than b = 'U';).  Please correct the mistake or at least note that it would case an error and describe why that error would happen as written.

<li><p>Sept. 8: <a href="homework/hw2.pdf">Homework 2</a> is available; it will be due on Monday, Sept. 16, by 11:59pm.  Note that you are also welcome to submit the written paper portion in class that morning, if you prefer, rather than submitting via email.

<li><p>Aug. 29: <a href="homework/hw1.pdf">Homework 1</a> is available; it will be due next Saturday, Sept. 7, by 11:59pm.  Note that this homework must be completed individually.

<li><p> Aug. 28: Note that we will have a normal lecture tomorrow (Thursday), and the lab will be on Friday this week.  (In general, labs will always be on Thursdays for the rest of the semester unless otherwise specifically announced.)

<li><p> Aug. 28: <a href="http://cs.slu.edu/~goldwasser/publications/python2cpp.pdf">Here</a> is the link to the transition guide from Python to C++; our lectures will be largely based on this document for the first few weeks of class.

<li><p> August 20: Welcome to CS180!  Please be sure to read course policies
carefully, and check this page daily for updates or announcements.

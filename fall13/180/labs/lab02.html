<h2>Lab 2: Copier Reduction</h2>

<h3>Lab</h3>



<p>What do you do if you need to copy a 560x400mm image onto
a standard sheet of US letter-size paper (which is about 216x280mm),
while keeping the image as large as possible?  You can rotate the
image 90 degrees (so that it is in &quot;landscape&quot; mode), then
reduce it to 50% of its original size so that it is 200x280mm.  Then
it will fit on the paper without overlapping any edges.  Your job is
to solve this problem in general.</p>

<p><b>Input:</b> The input consists of one or more test cases, each of
which is a single line containing four positive integers <i>A</i>,

<i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, and <i>D</i>, separated by a space, representing
an <i>A</i>x<i>B</i>mm image and a <i>C</i>x<i>D</i>mm piece of paper.
All inputs will be less than one thousand.  Following the test cases
is a line containing four zeros that signals the end of the input.</p>

<p><b>Output:</b> For each test case, if the image fits on the sheet
of paper without changing its size (but rotating it if necessary),
then the output is 100%.  If the image must be reduced in order to
fit, the output is the largest <em>integer</em> percentage of its
original size that will fit (rotating it if necessary). Output the
percentage exactly as shown in the examples below.  You can assume
that no image will need to be reduced to less than 1% of its original
size, so the answer will always be an integer percentage between 1%
and 100%, inclusive.</p>

        1%<br>

    </tr>

<h3>Pre-lab</h3>
Suppose that the input is the following:<br>

<table><tr>
      <td style="font-family: monospace;">
      500 400 200 100<br>
      500 400 100 200<br>
      0 0 0 0<br>
      </td>
</tr></table>

By hand (or using a calcuator) figure out what the output would be 
for this input, and email the result to the instructor.

<h1>Hints</h1>

<p>
This is a straightforward problem. You need an outer while loop
because a single execution of the program must solve multiple trials
(one per line).  For a specific trial, solve the problem for the
original orientation and for the rotated orientation and output the
better of the two.  You will need a conditional or two to determine
the limiting dimensions.

<p>
If you want to save yourself a bit of trouble, write a utility
function to compute the proper percentage for a <em>fixed</em>
orientation.  Then you can call that function twice, inverting the
parameters for the rotated case.


<p>
The most common mistakes resulted from ignoring details in the problem
specifications. Most importantly
<ul>
  <li>

      <p>
      Do not make any assumptions about the height being greater than
      or less than the width, for the paper or the picture.
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      Make sure to handle integer arithmetic properly.  For example,
      if the highest possible floating-point scale factor is 70.98,
      the output should be 70%, because it is possible to fit the 70%
      image but not possible to fit the 71% image.

  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      You are never to scale the picture to bigger than 100%.
  </li>

</ul>

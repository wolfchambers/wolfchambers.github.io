<h3> Announcements: </h3>
<ul>

<li><p>April 23: I have posted a <a href="finalreview.pdf">final review 
guide</a>, which is just a list of questions covering material AFTER the 
midterm.  Please note that it covers only material (roughly) since the 
midterm!  For material from the first half, which you are responsible for
on the final as well, please see the <a href="midtermreview.pdf">midterm review guide</a>.  You'll also get a sample final handed out in class next Tuesday.

<li><p>April 21: The final exam in this course will be Thursday, May 7, at noon.  Please let me know ASAP if you have a conflict and need to reshedule this exam.

<li><p>April 21:  The final lab, covering intrusion detection, is now available on DETER.  It is due next Thursday, April 30.

<li><p>April 7: The next lab, covering computer forensics, is now available on the DETER system.  It is due next Thursday, April 16, by 11:59pm.

<li><p>April 1: I have just reset permissions on the lab, which had accidentally been set to lock down on the due date.  You should now have more time, so that those taking the 3 day extension will be able to run on DETER now.

<li><p> March 26: Remember that we will not have class all next week, as I am out of the office on Tuesday and we have the Easter break starting Thursday.  

<li><p> March 5:  Also, as a reminder, I have posted the next lab (lab 4) on DETER, so 
please log in there to get details.  I will go ahead and post in case you would like to start over break,
but the official release date is Tuesday, March 17, and it is due on Tuesday, March 31.  Note 
that there are three parts to this lab, and that you are again being given two full weeks because I 
expect that you will need them, so please don't put this one off!  
You are welcome (and encouraged) to work with a partner, 
and please let me know if you would like a partner but have not yet found one in the class - I'll try 
to match up students if possible.

<li><p> March 5: For the essay due by the start of class on Tuesday, March 17 (right after break), 
I'd like you to put yourself in
the mindset of a security expert evaluating different systems or
protocols.  To this end, select one paper from the following list: <a 
href="http://www.lasr.cs.ucla.edu/reiher/papers/defcom.pdf">collaborative
DDoS defenses</a>, <a 
href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-design.pdf">Tor
(the onion router mentioned in class)</a>, and <a 
href="http://www.lasr.cs.ucla.edu/classes/239_1.spring03/papers/JSAC_S-BGP_article.htm">
Secure BGP</a>. Each of these dives more deeply into a protocol or
system we discussed in class that is designed to secure some aspect of internet
communication.  I'd like this essay to contain a brief summary of
what it is protecting and how, along with your opinion on if it works
(or will work if newer or not currently implemented).  Please be sure to
summarize both relevant strenths and weaknesses, and feel free to gather data
on how implementation has proceeded if it is an older protocol or solution.
The format will be the same as the last essay, so please refer to that handout, and
the grading rubric will also be similar to our first essay.

<li><p> Feb. 9: A reminder that there are two interesting talks coming up.  The first is math/cs club this Wednesday, where they will be talking about web application security - see more <a href="http://mathcs.slu.edu/webp/math-cs-club/web-application-security">here</a>.  The second is hosted for alums, but might be appropriate for us also - see the announcement and details <a href="http://alumni.slu.edu/s/1264/index.aspx?sid=1264&pgid=3951&gid=1&cid=6275&ecid=6275&post_id=0">here</a>.

<li><p> Feb. 2: <a href="assignments/lab02.html">Lab 2</a> on firewalls is now available.  
(Note that I posted the writeup here rather than on DETER, to avoid the issues we had last time.)
It will be due via email next Thursday, Feb. 12, by 11:59pm.
Remember that you are welcome to work with a partner on this one; if you do, please submit once for the pair of you (with the other person cc-ed on the email so it is clear who your partner is).

<li><p> Jan. 29: I have to modify my office hours tomorrow, because of a doctor's appointment in the morning.  I should be in by 10:30 and will be open until 11 or 11:30, and I'll also be available and in my office in the afternoon between 3 and 4.  Sorry for the change!

<li><p> Jan. 26: The next <a href="assignments/cryptohw.pdf">homework</a> (on crypto) has been posted; it will be due next Tuesday, Feb. 3, by the start of class.

<li><p>Jan. 23: A clarification for DETER submissions.  Their submission instructions actually seem to be working great (after checking when the first few submissions arrived), so there's no need to email me the tarball if you want to submit that way.  

<li><p> Jan. 15: I have emailed all registered students their DETER accounts, as well as assigned Lab 1 (available on the DETER site).  Note that there is quite a bit of reading, so I'd advise at least starting to review it this weekend.  It will be due on Monday, Jan. 26, via email to the instructor (by 11:59pm).

<li><p> Jan. 13: The first essay summary is due next Tuesday, January 20, at the start of class.  (Please see the <a href="assignments/">Assignments page</a> for details and the essay.)

<li><p> Welcome to CS443!  Please be sure to read course policies carefully, and check this page 
daily for updates or announcements.

<h3> Announcements: </h3>
<ul>

<li><p> Dec. 12: In case it would be useful, <a href="http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/notes/H-lp.pdf">here</a> is another reference on LPs, written by the author of our main textbook.  You're not required to read it, but providing just in case it's helpful!

<li><p> Dec. 4: The final <a href="homeworks/hw10.pdf">worksheet</a> is now posted.  This will not be turned in, but one problem will appear on the final exam.

<li><P> Nov. 19: I went ahead and posted homework 9 early, just to avoid future issues with my computer.  It will be your last submitted homework, and will be due Dec. 4.  There will be a final worksheet, which will not be submitted for credit (but which will feature prominently on the final exam, just to motivate you working on it!)

<li><P> Nov. 18: Homework 8 is now posted; it will be due in 1 week, on Monday 11/25, by the start of class.

<li><p> Nov. 6: I will be a bit late to office hours tomorrow (Thursday), since I'm coming from a talk off-campus.  I should be here by 1:30pm at the latest.

<li><p> Nov. 6: Homework 7 is available; it will be due next Friday, Nov. 15, as a written homework.

<li><p>Oct. 29: I went ahead and posted the readings for next week (Monday and Wednesday); Monday's is quite short, and Wednesday we'll finish up the rest of Chapter 10.  Note that we are skipping section 10.5, although you're welcome to read it on your own!

<li><p> Oct. 25: Homework 6 is now available; it will be graded orally on Monday and Tuesday, Nov. 4-5.  Please sign up for a slot on Monday 10/28 in class!

<li><p> Oct. 18: I'm extended the deadline for homework 5; you are welcome to submit anytime before 5pm on Thursday, 10/24.  If you can't catch me in my office, you are also welcome to drop it off in my mailbox in the main CS department office.  I'll plan to pick up assignments there at 5pm before I leave.

<li><p> Oct. 14: Homework 5 is now available; it will be a written homework due the Wednesday after break.  You may work in groups as usual.

<li><p> Sept. 20: Homework 4 is now available.  It will be graded orally next Monday and Tuesday; please make sure to have someone in your group present to sign up for a time slot this Wednesday in class.

<li><p>Sept. 27: A bit of scheduling: The midterm exam will be Friday, Oct. 11 during class; it will cover the material up to greedy algorithms (which is chapter 4 and will be homework 4).  I'll hand out a practice midterm before then, and there are TONS of practice problems in the text.  I'll also have a review session in class on Wednesday, Oct. 9.

<li><p> Sept. 23: Homework 3 is now available!  It will be due on Monday, Sept. 30, by the start of class.

<li><p> Sept. 18: Slight bug on homework 2: The statement for problem 3 had an i+i where I meant i+1.  I've updated the file now, so be sure to double check.

<li><p> Sept. 18: HW0 grades are now on blackboard; please check to be sure I've recorded your grade correctly.

<li><p> Sept. 16:  I just released Perusall scores so far.  The scores range between 0 and 3; I'm going to grade each reading out of 2, so that you don't have to get a 3 in order to make "full credit".  Remember, I'll also drop your lowest 2-3 readings at the end of the semester, so no worries if you miss one along the way - just don't let it happen too often.

<li><p> Sept. 13: In case anyone wants a good "cheat sheet": there is a nicely compiled one, 
called the <a href="https://www.tug.org/texshowcase/cheat.pdf">theoretical computer science cheat 
sheet</a>, which contains lots of definitions, identities, and useful theorems (like Master theorem).
Please don't feel like you have to use it, but sharing just in case it would be useful!

<li><p> Sept. 13: Homework 2 is posted; this one will be graded orally (in groups) next Thursday and Friday morning.  Stay tuned for a sign up sheet on Monday!

<li><p> Sept. 10: There's a bug on homework 1, in problem 1 part E.  This should be E(n) = E(n-1)^2 - E(n-2)^2.

<li><p> Sept. 6: I've just posted the final version of hw1, available on the homework page. (Note that there was a slight change from yesterday to today, so please refresh and make sure you have the newest version sometime today!)

<li><p> Sept. 4: I've decided not to assign another reading on Perusall for 
Friday; instead, please use the time to review any background material you may 
need for homework 0.  In particular, don't forget that I require proofs! You'll 
need a proof of correctness for your algorithm in number 3 (although it won't 
necessarily be induction, but more likely a direct proof), and problem 4 should 
be proven using induction.  In case you're in need of a discrete math 
reference/refresher, there are several references that are free - I like <a 
href="http://mfleck.cs.illinois.edu/building-blocks/">Building Blocks for 
Theoretical Computer Science</a>, or the textbook author has appendices on both 
<a 
href="http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/notes/98-induction.pdf">induction</a> 
and <a 
href="http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/notes/99-recurrences.pdf">recurrences</a>. 
Of course, if you saved your discrete math textbook, that will also be a great 
reference!

<li><p> Sept. 3: I need to shuffle office hours a bit from what I'd announced in my email, because 
of a last minute meeting from 10-11am tomorrow.  I'll have office hours at 11am tomorrow 
(Wednesday), and Thursday 1-2pm.  Let me know if you need to arrange a different time, and we'll 
arrange something.

<li><p> Sept. 2: Two announcements: I'm extending the due date for HW0 to this Friday at the start 
of class, if anyone needs extra time.  Also, we'll be meeting in 323 Ritter for class from here on 
out.

<li><p> Aug. 28: I changed the due dates slightly for the readings; you now have one due on Friday, and the 3rd (covering part 2 of chapter 1) is not due until next Wednesday.  Note that both of these are on material covered in the video that I suggested watching in my email.

<li><p> Aug. 20: Homework 0 is now available (on the homework page linked above); it will be completed individually, and due on Wednesday, Sept. 4 at the beginning of class.

<li> <p> Aug. 20: I emailed an announcement to the entire class regarding the 
first week of class, when I'll be out of town. Please read carefully, and get in touch with me ASAP if you did not get the email.

<li> <p>Aug. 12: Welcome to Algorithms!  Please make sure to read the course 
policies carefully, and remember to check this announcements section daily for
new announcements or reminders.

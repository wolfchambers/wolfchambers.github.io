<h2>  Final project </h2>

Grades for this class will be based primarily on a final project, broken into 3 parts: a paper chase, a proposal, and a final report.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Each individual student submits a "paper chase" by <b>October 10</b>.  This is a warmup exercise in diving into the resarch literature.  I will provide a 
list of relevant recent papers to use as possible starting points.  From there, each student will find an interesting computational topology paper; read it until 
htey get lost; find another paper that sheds light on the first; read it until they get lost; find a third paper that sheds light on the first two; read it until 
they get lost; and finally submits a review of all three papers.  Each "paper chase" review should be 3–5 pages long.

<li> Each individual student submits a project proposal by October 27.  This is a hard deadline.</b> Proposals should be 2-3 pages long, and 
should include a crisp self-contained statement of the proposed topic, a <em>brief</em> survey of known results, a potential plan of attack, and one or two 
half-baked ideas that probably won't work but what the heck you might get lucky.  (More details below)

<li> Finally, teams of up to three students collaborate on a project.  Each team will submit a written document by December 12 (by default, about 10-15 
pages) and give a short presentation during the last week of two of class (by default, about 20-30 minutes).

</ul></p>


Projects can take one of many forms:

<ul>

<li> Theoretical work: Attempt to solve an interesting, non-trivial, and preferably open theoretical problem related to topological data analysis (TDA).

<li> Experimental: Implement and experimentally evaluate TDA appraoches for some problem. 
Projects of this type can include some data set that could benefit from the use of TDA, or some visualization or interpretation of some TDA analysis,
or be a comparison of different TDA methods on a type of data.  (This is not meant to be exhaustive, as there are many ways to use the tools we'll discuss.)

<li> Scholarly: Write a comprehensive survey of a topic in or related to TDA. Surveys should be about 15-20 pages long, and should include a 
history of the topic, a description of motivating applications, a summary of known results, sketches of the most uses and/or proofs, 
suggestions for further research, and a thorough bibliography.  Pictures are also highly encouraged to illustrate the workings!

<li> Creative: Make a youtube video, or interactive demo related to TDA, preferably one that doesn't have a lot of information 
available on the web.  Or you can substantially improve the Wikipedia articles for an advanced data structures topics.  Or come see me if you have other
creative ideas!  The idea is to show significant knowledge on some topic in TDA, but I'm prepared to be flexible for this category.

</ul>

<p> Students are strongly encouraged to work on projects motivated by their primary research/development interests. In particular, project topics need not 
be limited to the specific topics covered in class, as long as they focus on data structures. Especially for theoretical projects, you should work on 
problems whose solution you want to know but don't.


<p>One month before the end of the semester, each student will submit a project proposal. Project proposals are due on October 27; I'll give 
feedback on each the following week. (Note that this is a hard deadline - no extentions!) Proposals should be 2-3 pages in length, and should include 
a brief and self-contained statement of the proposed topic or work, a brief survey of known results (which I'll double check), a potential plan of 
attack, and one or two half-baked ideas that probably won't work but what the heck you might get lucky. After everything is submitted, I will post all 
submitted proposals to this web page as inspiration for final projects, and we'll spend time in class discussing groups and which projects to pursue.

<p>The ideal result of the project is something that can be polished into a publishable paper. This ideal is meant to be an attractive goal, not an 
absolute requirement - most research is not immediately successful, after all! If you do not find a complete solution, your writeup and presentation 
should describe partial results (for example, incremental improvements for some interesting special cases), promising approaches for ongoing work, 
what you did and where you got stuck in implementation, remaining questions where you're still stumped, and most importantly, ideas that initially 
looked promising but weren't (and why). Of course, this will vary slightly depending on what type of project you have, so plan to come discuss this 
with me after proposals are submitted.

As a standing rule, I will give any student who publishes in a peer-reviewed conference or journal as a direct result of work in this class an A+. I 
can and will apply this rule retroactively even after the semester ends (at least until the university won't let me anymore - eventually these freeze).



<h3>Hey, wait!  How do we find good problems?</h3>

Excellent question!  Here are a few hopefully useful suggestions, and I'm happy to discuss with you further as needed:

<ul>

<li><p> Talk to people! This is probably the single most important suggestion I can make. Other people have ideas, intuition, and experience that you don't; just 
as importantly, you have ideas, intuition, and experience that other people don't! Tell other people your half-baked ideas and listen to theirs. See if they know 
how to solve your random questions, and try to answer theirs. Ask for suggestions for papers to read, or techniques to try, or problems to think about, and offer 
your own in exchange. If you're really lucky, you'll find that you have enough background in common to work together. Great!

<li><p> Talk to your supervisor and/or advisor, and talk to me!
Are there places in your research that TDA would be useful?  What libraries or tools could you investigate?  What type of implementations or tools don't exist?  


<li> <p> Go read some papers.  Many research papers end with a laundry list of open problems.  Even if there's no explicit list, <em>very</em> few papers 
describe results that cannot be improved in some way: efficiency, generality, elegance, or all of the above.  Look especially for the questions that 
nobody is asking!  Reading papers is not only a good source of problems, but also the best way to understand what people already know, what people 
care about, and what people expect in a research publication.  For this class, I'd suggest starting with papers discussed in 
class, data structures you've used and been interested to learn more about, or feel free to look at other advanced data structures classes.

<li> <p> Tweak an existing result. 
If the best algorithm is randomized, can you get the same performance deterministically?  If the best 
algorithm is deterministic, is there a simpler randomized solution?  Can you efficiently maintain the solution as the input changes?  Can that 
constant 5 be changed to 10000, or to 1+ε?  What if you have to pay for individual bit operations?  What if you can perform rotations for free?  What 
if you only care about cache misses?  Can you solve the same problem for sets of strings as efficiently as for sets of numbers?  What if the points 
are moving?  How good an approximation can you compute in linear time?  In sublinear time?  What if you're only allowed to scan through the data once?  
What if you can only use constant space or constant time?  What if you use ellipses instead of circles?  Does it work in higher dimensions?  Can you 
run the algorithm backward in time?  In parallel?  What if the computer can lie to you occasionally?  Can you turn the problem into a game?  What if 
the nodes have colors, the edges have negative weights, the disks are magnetized, the strawberries taste like strawberries, and the snozzberries taste 
like snozzberries?  Don't worry (at first) about whether your questions make sense, or if they're impossible, or if they're trivial.  The goal is just 
to come up with questions.

<li> <p> Go look at youtube videos on TDA - the AARTN online talks are a great place to start.  Is there a problem or application you find interesting
that they discuss there?  Go find the paper, and then read my next suggestion!

<li> <p> Wander around at random. Start with an interesting paper.  Look up other papers cited in its bibliography.  Find the paper on CiteSeer 
or Google Scholar and look at newer papers that cite those.  Go to the authors' web pages and look at their other papers.  Google for an interesting 
phrase or an unfamiliar piece of terminology.  Look at other papers in the same journal or conference proceedings, or on the same shelf at the 
library.


<li> <p> Go check out wikipedia.  Are there entries for all the topics we cover?  Do they actually help you understand the tool and/or algorithm?  
Can you come up with a way to improve a few of these?  (Note that wikipedia tends to be pretty good, in large part because CS students and faculty 
take the time to improve it, but that doesn't mean it can't be improved!)


<li><p>Solve some problems. Ultimately, the only way to learn how to find good problems, and to learn how to solve them, is by actually doing it. Pick a problem. Try 
to solve it. If you succeed, what other problems does your solution suggest? What other problems seem likely to fall to your solution technique? If the solution 
was too easy, tweak the problem to make it harder. If you get stuck, try to formalize why you're stuck; you might be trying to do something impossible! Or tweak 
the problem to make it easier—consider a useful special case, or ignore the cost of some pesky operation. It's relatively rare for any open problem to be solved in 
its original stated form; more often, the problem and its solution evolve together as the research progresses.


<li><p> Write everything down. Keep a research notebook with you at all times. (I strongly recommend paper over anything electronic, but use something you feel comfortable 
with.) Whenever you see, read, hear, or think of something even remotely interesting or relevant to your research, write it down. Especially write down half-baked 
ideas and "stupid" questions. Periodically read through your own notes; you'll be surprised at how much stuff you see (and think of!) in a single year. As you 
mature as a researcher, the content of your notebook will slowly will drift away from ideas you get from other people and toward your own thoughts and discoveries.

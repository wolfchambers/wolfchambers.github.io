<h3> Announcements: </h3>
<ul>

<li><p> Dec 12: For the final paper/project: please send your writeup to me by the end of 
the day on Wednesday, Dec. 17, at the absolute latest, so that I will have time to read and assign 
final grades.

<li><p> Dec 4: Just a reminder that we will start our last few classes (on Dec. 5, Dec. 8, and Dec. 10) 10 minutes early, at 12:40pm, to allow enough time for all the groups to present.  See you tomorrow!

<li><p> Dec. 1: With apologies, I need to cancel class (and the student presentations) on Wednesday, as I will be at my aunt's funeral.  Stay tuned for a make-up time, once I inquire about logistics.

  <li><p> Dec. 1: Reminder that student presentations begin today, for final projects.  If you do not yet have a time to present set up, 
please email me immediately so we can coordinate one, as all class slots are now filled.

  <li><p> Nov 5: Please email me pdf copies of project proposals, rather than submitting on canvas.  (Grades will still be reported there, after I have reviewed them all.)

  <li><p> Oct 23: The final assignments in class will be for our final project.  The first (hard) deadline is for 
you to submit your project proposal by November 5.  Proposals should be 2-3 pages long, and should include a clear 
and self-contained statement of the proposed topic, a brief survey of known or related results, a potential plan of 
attack, and perhaps a few crazy ideas that may or may not work.  Please see the final project description on the  <a 
href="homeworks/index.html">homework page</a> for more ideas of project forms, and then feel free to come discuss 
with me in office hours if you have questions or need some ideas.

  <li><p> Oct 8: With apologies, I need to cancel class for today due to illness.  I hope to return and see you all 
on Friday.

  <li><p> Oct 1: HW4 (the paper chase assignemt) is posted.  In addition, <a href="homeworks/paperchase-rubric.pdf">here is a sample rubric</a> that I will be using when grading these essays, to give you an idea of what I'm looking for.  If you have any questions about paper choice, please message me or come by to discuss!

  <li> <p> Sept 17: HW3 is posted.  Remember that there is no class the week of Sept. 22, as I'll be traveling, so please use class time to watch a video and work on an essay!

  <li> <p> Sept 10: HW2 has been posted, and will be due Monday September 22.

  <li> <p> Aug: 25: HW1 has been posted, and will be due on Monday September 8.

  <li> <p> Aug. 25: I'm assigning an easy "homework 0" for all registered students, in an effort to get to know each of you: please send me an 
email this week, and tell me a bit about yourself!  I'm curious to hear about your course background, especially in math or algorithms, as 
well as your research interests and experience.  If you have any questions for me, please also send them along in the same email!

  <li> <p> Welcome to the TDA webpage!  I'll be using this page to post public information, 
including lecture notes and announcemets;  please check Canvas for homework submission and gradebook.
      Please make sure to read the <a href="policies.html">course policies</a> carefully, and 
remember to check this announcements section regularly for
      new announcements or reminders.

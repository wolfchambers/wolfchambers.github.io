  <h3>ACM's International Collegiate Programming Contest</h3>
  <p>
  This year, each of our lab assignments will be based on a problem taken from
  a past offering of the ACM International Collegiate Programming
  Contest (ICPC).  Students work in teams of three to solve as many
  problems as possible in a five-hour time period.

  <p>
  Hundreds of regional contests are held each Fall, involving
  thousands of teams across the world.  The top 100 teams from the
  regionals qualify for the World Finals held in the Spring.
  More information can be found on the <a
  href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/">official ICPC site</a>.
  Also, if you have any interest in participating on
  <a href="/~goldwasser/icpc">SLU's teams</a>, please let me know next
  Fall.

  <p>
  Each problem is computational in nature, with the goal being to
  compute a specific output based on some input parameters.
  Each problem defines a clear and unambigous form for the expected input
  and desired output.  Relevant bounds on the size of the input
  are clearly specified. To be successful, the program must complete
  within 60 seconds on the given machine (thus, efficiency can be
  important for certain problems).

  <p>
  Each problem description offers a handful of sample inputs and the
  expected output for those trials as a demonstration.  Behind the
  scene, the judges often have hundreds of additional tests.
  Submitted programs are "graded" by literally running them on all of
  the judges' tests, capturing the output, and comparing whether the
  output is identical (character-for-character) to the expected output.

  <p>
  If the test is successful, the team gets credit for completing the
  problem.  If the test fails, the team is informed of the failure and
  allowed to resubmit (with a slight penalty applied).  However, the
  team receives very little feedback from the judges.  In essence,
  they are told that it failed but given no explanation as to the
  cause of the problem, or even the data set that leads to the
  problem.

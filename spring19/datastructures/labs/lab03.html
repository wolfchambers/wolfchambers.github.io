<h1>Speed Limit</h1>


<p>Bill and Ted are taking a road trip.  But the odometer in their car
is broken, so they don't know how many miles they have
driven. Fortunately, Bill has a working stopwatch, so they can record
their speed and the total time they have driven. Unfortunately, their
record keeping strategy is a little odd, so they need help computing
the total distance driven. You are to write a program to do this
computation. </p>

<p>For example, if their log shows</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="1"
 style="text-align: left;">

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top" style="text-align: center;">Speed in miles per
hour<br>
          </td>
          <td valign="top" style="text-align: center;">Total elapsed time
in  hours<br>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td valign="top" style="text-align: center;">20<br>
          </td>
          <td valign="top" style="text-align: center;">2<br>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top" style="text-align: center;">30<br>

          </td>
          <td valign="top" style="text-align: center;">6<br>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top" style="text-align: center;">10<br>
          </td>
          <td valign="top" style="text-align: center;">7<br>

          </td>
        </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>this means they drove 2 hours at 20 miles per hour, then 6-2=4
hours at 30 miles per hour, then 7-6=1 hour at 10 miles per hour. The
distance driven is then (2)(20) + (4)(30) + (1)(10) = 40 + 120 + 10 =
170 miles. Note that the total elapsed time is always since the
beginning of the trip, not since the previous entry in their log. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Input:</span> The input consists of one
 or more data sets. Each set starts with a line  containing an
 integer
<i>n</i>,  1 &#8804; <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>  &#8804; 10,&nbsp; followed
by  <i>n</i> pairs of values, one pair per line. The  first value in a pair,

<span style="font-style: italic;">s,</span> is the  speed in miles per hour
and the second value, <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span>, is the
total elapsed time. Both <span style="font-style: italic;">s</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">t</span> are integers, 1 &#8804;<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> s</span> &#8804; 90 and 1 &#8804;<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> t</span> &#8804; 12.&nbsp; The values for <span
 style="font-style: italic;">t </span>are always in strictly increasing order.
  A value of -1 for <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> signals the
 end of the input. </p>

 the distance driven, followed by a space, followed by the word "miles".&nbsp;

<h3>Prelab</h3>

Suppose that the input to the program is:
<table><tr>
      <td style="font-family: monospace;">
      3<br>
      50 2<br>
      25 3<br>
      35 6<br>
      2<br>
      10 2<br>
      20 4<br>
      -1<br><br>
      </td>
</tr></table>
What would the precise output be? Email your answer to the instructor.

<h3>Hints and warnings</h3>

<p>
Don't forget to complete and submit this lab via the ZyBook interface; a
blank template has been provided in the assignment there.

<p>
Keep in mind that your submitted program must be able to analyze
multiple, independent trials.  A common mistake on programming
contests is to forget to reinitialize all relevant variables with each
new trial (so that the computation on one trial does not adversely
affect the computation for the next trial).

<!--<h3>Hints</h3>

<p>
This is a rather straightforward problem, as described. But let me
explain why I chose the problem for this lab.  The key is to determine
how much state information you need to be able to process the
travelers' log, one line at a time.  Although the syntax of
object-oriented programming might be overkill in the race against
time, the thought process is important.


If I were to define a class for use in this problem, it would have a
basic structure as follows:
<pre>
class TravelLog {
  public:
    /** initialize a new (empty) log.  */
    <b>TravelLog() { ... }</b>

    /** Add a new entry to the log.
     *  @param   speed      current speed in miles per hour
     *  @param   clockTime  elapsed time since beginning of trip (in hours)
     */
    <b>void addEntry(int speed, int clockTime) { ... }</b>

    /** Returns the total number of miles traveled.
     *  @return number of miles
     */
    <b>int getTotalMiles() const { ... }</b>

  private:
    //  <b>??? state information ???</b>

};
</pre>
There are three basic operations.  (1) initialize the internal state
for a new trip, (2) process one additional log entry, and (3) 
report the total number of miles traveled on the current log.

The challenge for you is to determine what internal variables are
needed to support these operations.
<b>
In particular, it is not necessary to store all of the raw log
entries.  You can consolidate the relevant information into a few well chosen
variables.
</b>
With a wise choice of variables, the rest of the problem is easy.

<p>
I will leave it up to you as to whether you actually want to use such
a <tt>TravelLog</tt> class as part of your program, or to do
similar calculations in a non-object-oriented way.  Either is quite fine!
But in either case, you need to have a strategy for tracking the progress
of a trip.



<p>
<b>Warning:</b>
Keep in mind that your submitted program must be able to analyze
multiple, independent trials.  A common mistake on programming
contests is to forget to reinitialize all relevant variables with each
new trial (so that the computation on one trial does not adversely
affect the computation for the next trial).
So if using such a <tt>TravelLog</tt> class, make sure to start with a
new instance for each trip (or if doing this problem implicitly with your
own variables, make sure to reinitialize them for each new trip).-->

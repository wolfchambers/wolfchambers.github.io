<h1>Lab 1: Compiling and runnning C++ programs</h1>

<p>

<h2>Pre-lab:</h2>

Email Dr. Chambers and tell her what programming or other computer 
experience you have had before, why you are taking this class, and what you 
hope to get out of the semester in class.  Also, to give a bit of 
background, please give your major and your minor, and (if you have any 
ideas) what type of job you are interested in having after you finish your 
degree at SLU.

<br>

<h2>Lab 1, Jan. 17 at 2pm</h2>

<p>Open up your ZyLabs content.  Your first assignment should be there - run through the exercises, and don't forget to submit it!  You have until the end of the day to do so.

<p> Once you finish lab 1, look for the first homework - I'd recommend starting it during lab tomorrow, since you can then ask me questions as you get going.

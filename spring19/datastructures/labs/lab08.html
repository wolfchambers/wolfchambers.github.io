<h1>Tree Grafting 1</h1>


<p>

Trees have many applications in computer science. Perhaps the most commonly
used trees are rooted binary trees, but there are other types of rooted
trees that may be useful as well. One example is ordered trees, in
which the subtrees for any given node are ordered. The number of
children of each node is variable, and there is no limit on the number.
Formally, an ordered tree consists of a finite set of nodes T such that

<ul>
<li> there is one node designated as the root, denoted root(T);<br></li>
<li> the remaining nodes are partitioned into subsets T1, T2, ..., Tm, each of which is also a tree (subtrees).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an example of such a tree, with three subtrees of the root.
<blockquote><pre>
         0   
       / | \ 
      1  2  3
        / \  
       4   5 
</pre></blockquote>

<p>You are asked to write a program that computes the height of the tree.


<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is given by a number of lines giving the directions taken
in a depth-first traversal of the trees. There is one line for each
tree.  For example, the tree above would give dudduduudu, meaning 0
down to 1, 1 up to 0, 0 down to 2, etc. The input is terminated by a
line whose first character is #. You may assume that each tree has at
least 2 and no more than 10000 nodes.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each tree, print the heights of the tree. Use the format:
<blockquote><pre>
Tree t: h
</pre></blockquote>
where t is the case number (starting from 1), and h is the height of the
tree.
</p>



<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
          <thead>  <tr>
           <td><b>Example input:</b></td>
            <td><b>Example output:</b></td>
          </tr>
          </thead>  <tbody>

<h1>Hints</h1>

<p>
Although this problem can be trivially solved by keeping count of the
depth as you parse the input, this lab is really a warmup for next
week's lab (which was the real contest problem).  For that reason, I
recommend that you consider intentionally approaching this lab with the
following recursive approach.
In the end we want a
function that can compute the depth of the entire tree;  we will
design a recursion that computes the depth of any subtree.  Consider
the following local view:
</p>

<img src="../../../spring18/datastructures/labs/view.gif">

<p>
If you were told the  depths for each of the four children,
can you compute the  depth of the larger subtree?   



<p>
Here is how we recommend setting up the recursion.  Remember that the
original input is just a sequence of 'd' and 'u' designators to
describe the shape of the tree.   We want to think about starting the
recursion at the root.  Technically, there is no 'd'/'u' pair in the
input for going down to the root up up from it, but for consistency
sake, <b><em>we recommend that you alter the original input string by adding
a preceding 'd' and a trailing 'u'.</em></b>   Then use a string iterator
to implicitly traverse the tree as you do your computation.  Use the
following signature.
<pre>
  /*
   * Return the depth of the subtree rooted at the iterator position in the
   * input string and advance the iterator so that it ends up at the character
   * just beyond the 'u' that ended the subtree traversal
   */
  int depth(string::iterator& i);
</pre>
Assume that the function is called at a time when the iterator is
pointing to the initial 'd' that moves down to a node.   This call is
supposed to compute the depth of the
subtree at that node, and while doing so it should advance the
iterator so that it is one spot past the final 'u' that designates
moving back up from the given node (note that we pass the iterator as
a non-const reference so that the caller will continue scanning after
the characters that we've processed).
</p>


<p>
As an example, consider the original input, <big><tt>dudduduudu</tt></big>. After
our recommended padding, we would have the string
<big><tt><b>d</b>dudduduudu<b>u</b></tt></big>. The top level
recursion would be called with the iterator in position as:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<big><tt><u>d</u>dudduduuduu</tt></big>
<br>
and the goal would be that at the end of that call it returns value 2
and leaves the iterator at the end position,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<big><tt>ddudduduuduu<u>&nbsp;</u></tt></big>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Of course, if you would like to understand how the recursion works,
the top level call would eventually have made three different
recursive calls (although its not clear at the onset how many calls
will be needed). The first of those calls would be portrayed as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<big><tt>d<u>d</u>udduduuduu</tt></big>
<br>
and that call would end having returned 0 to reflect the depth of the
rather trivial subtree it analyzed, leaving the iterator as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<big><tt>d<b>du</b><u>d</u>duduuduu</tt></big>
<br>
just beyond the portion of the string that represented the trivial
subtree (shown in bold). The second recursive call starts in that
state, and will eventually return 1 after analyzing the portion of the
string shown in bold below, with the final iteration position advanced:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<big><tt>ddu<b>dduduu</b><u>d</u>uu</tt></big>
<br>
A third recursive call would process the third subtree of the original
root, return 0 and leaving the iterator as follows:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<big><tt>ddudduduudu<u>u</u></tt></big>
<br>
At this point, the recursion can recognize that there are no more
children of the original root, and can return value of 2 as the depth
(given that we witnessed subtrees having depths 0, 1, and 0 respectively).

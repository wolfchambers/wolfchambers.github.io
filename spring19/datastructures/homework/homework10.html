<p> 

For this assignment, you will be implementing breadth first search or depth first search (your choice) to 
check connectivity in a graph.  However, this will be a particular kind of weighted graph, and the goal of 
checking connectivity will be to decide if a particular routing algorithm will reach every node.

More precisely, you'll be specifying a graph as a set of nodes, each with a particular location (an 
x-coordinate and y-coordinate).  The nodes need to send messages to each other.  However, each node can 
only send to two other nodes, which will be the two closest ones.  If there are ties for who to send to, 
the node will send to the one which is the furthest to the left (so smallest x-coordinate); if that 
still leaves a tie, then it will send the lowest on the map (so smallest y-coordinate).

Given a start vertex, the goal of your program is to decide if

In this course, a follow-up to our introductory programming course CSCI 1300, 
students will learn how to utilize data structures in their programs to make their 
code more efficient in terms of speed and memory usage. They will also learn how to 
implement many of the most important data structures, and the trade-offs involved in 
different implementation decisions. (4 credit hour)

<LI> <H3><A name="textbook">Textbook</A></h3> <p> This semester, we will be using 
a ZyBooks text, combined with ZyLabs for some of the early programming 
assignments.  Do sign up, please do the following:
<ol>

<li> Sign in or create an account at learn.zybooks.com
<li> Enter zyBook code: SLUCSCI2100ChambersSpring2019
<li> Subscribe

</ol>

<p>Please note that you can download a pdf of the book, and I STRONGLY recommend 
that you do so!  Data structures questions are quite fundamental in CS, and are a 
huge part of most technical interviews for jobs, so it is likely you will want 
this reference later in yoru career.

</li>

<li>
<h3><a name="email">Email</a></h3>
<p>
Email contact with the course instructor is a necessity in this class, since homework 
will all submitted via email.  I will check email several times throughout the work 
day, and will also check email once per evening to answer questions and resolve issues.
Email contact over the weekend may be more sporadic, although I will be sure to check
at least once.
</li>

<li>
<h3><a name="git">Git</a></h3>
<p>
We will use a git system this year to submit many of the homeworks.  Details on how to sign up and use the system will be posted on the announcement page and discussed in class.
</p>
</li>

<LI>
<h3><A name="additionalmaterial">Additional Material</a></h3>   
 Additional articles or online references may be provided throughout the semeseter at 
the instructor's discretion; please reference the schedule throughout the semester 
for such additions.  I will also try to post lecture notes from class every day, 
although please keep in mind that these are not a guarantee or a replacement for 
attending lecture.
</li>

<li> <h3><A name="computercell">Computer and Cell Phone Policy</a></h3>
    <p> Computers will be an integral part of this course, both inside and
      outside of class.  However, out of courtesy to both the instructor and
      other students, please do not use the lab computers for non-class
      related activity.  In particular, you do not need to be using a computer
      unless an exercise or in class activity requiring them is in progress.
      </p>
    <p> You are unlikely to need cell phones during the course of lecture.  Please
ensure that your cell phone is set to vibrate or silent during lecture, and do not send
text messages of any kind.  </p>

<ul>

    <li> <h3><A name="gradedwork">Graded Work</A></H3>

    <ul> 
      
      <li>Lab Assignments (10%)
      

      <p>
       Most Thursdays will be devoted to a hands-on problem. Although we hope to 
have students complete it in class, we will allow each to be submitted anytime by 
11:59pm on the following Sunday.  Each lab will also have a pre-lab associated 
with it which will be due before class begins on the day of the lab.
      </p>

      <p>
      These problems will be graded automatically through ZyLabs.
      Each will have a simple pre-lab, which is worth 1 point.  
     The remaining points are awarded for a successful completion of the lab work, 
      based on how many test cases your program passes.  Note that completion of the prelab
	and an honest attempt at the lab will give at least some partial credit! 

      <p>At the end of the semester, <b>we will ignore your lowest of the
      lab grades,</b> with the remaining scores contributing
      equally to this portion of the grade.
      </p>

      <li> Zybooks reading (10%)

     <p> This semester, the course text will be an online text through ZyBooks.  
You will be required to do reading BEFORE class regularly; in addition, the book 
contains some simple exercises to reinforce the concepts.  Your solutions will not 
be graded for correctness, but the ZyBooks framework records participation credit 
for attempting - if you get the solution correct, you move on, and otherwise it 
requires a certain number of attempts on each question before showing you the 
correct solution.

<p> I will only score participation, but it is my hope that you will choose to 
engage with both the read and the reinforcement questions, as I think they are 
very helpful!  At the least, I can guarantee understanding them will improve your 
exam and homework scores, since I plan to build on them as much as possible.  I 
will also assume students have completed the reading, so that my lecture will 
continue from there; students who have not completed the reading are likely to be 
quite lost in class.

</li>

	<li> Programming Assignments and Written Homework (40%)
	
	<p> We expect about 12-13 assignments through the course of the semester.  
Some will be due via email submission (usually due by 11:59pm in these cases), 
while others may be done on paper and due at the start of class.  Please read the 
academic integrity section of this document carefully, since I expect students to 
work on their own material and hold to high standards of behavior on all 
assignments.

<p>      On certain assignments, you will be required to work individually;
      on others you will be allowed to work in pairs.
      Early in the course you will have approximately one week for each
      assignment;  later in the course you will often have two weeks.</p>

	<p> Students will also be able to drop their lowest programming or 
homework assignment score at the end of the semester.</p>

</li>

<li> Exams: (40% total)

<p> You will have a total of 3 exams over the course of the semster.  Midterms 1 
and 2 will each be worth 10%, and will take place rougly 1/3 and 2/3 of the way 
through the semester.  The final exam will be comprehensive, although it will focus more heavily on 
the last part of the course.  It will be worth 20% of your final score.

</li>
</ul>

    <LI> <H3><A name="percentages">Percentages</A></H3>

      <P>
      Letter grades will be based on each students overall
      percentage of awarded points according to the following
      formula.
      </P>
      
      <DL>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 93% will result in a grade of
	    A or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 90% will result in a grade of
	    A- or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 87% will result in a grade of
	    B+ or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 83% will result in a grade of
	    B or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 80% will result in a grade of
	    B- or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 77% will result in a grade of
	    C+ or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 73% will result in a grade of
	    C or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 70% will result in a grade of
	    C- or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 60% will result in a grade of
	    D or better.
	</DD>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage below 60% will result in a grade of
	    F.
	</DD>
      </DL>Any curving of this scale at the end of the year
      will be <EM>in favor of the students</EM>. In other words, I reserve the 
right to decide to award an A to a student who is slightly
      below the above cutoff, but I will never deny
      an A to someone who is above the cutoff.
  </LI>


  <li> <H3><A name="extracredit">Extra Credit</A></H3>

      <P>The 
      programming and homework assignments provided will be challenging enough
      for most students, so please focus as much as possible on the 
      assignments provided. 
      </P>

      <p> Upon occasion (and solely at the instructor's discretion), there may 
be small extra credit activities, either by announcement in class or as 
part of an assignment.  Please keep in mind that the extra credit is unlikely 
to significantly affect your grade; if you are concerned about your final 
grade, it is much better to focus your energy on the regular assignment.  Extra 
credit is solely designed to provide an opportunity to students who wish to 
explore the topics further. </p>

</li>
      
  <li> <h3><a name="latehomework">Late Homework</a></h3>

        <p> Homeworks will generally be due at 11:59pm via email.  Late 
submissions will generally not be accepted unless arrangements have been made 
ahead of time.  Please contact me as early as possible with any potential 
issues, since I am much more likely to grant an extension if you come to be 
ahead of time!  In general, I try to be flexible if students have good reason, 
but I do reserve the right to not accept late submissions if solutions have 
already been released or if a student is abusing this flexibility.

  </li>


  <li> <h3><a name="regrades">Regrade Requests</a></h3>

        <p> I am happy to regrade any assignments, programs, quizzes or exam 
problems which you think were unfair or incorrect.  You will never lose points 
for doing this, although I won't promise to always give you more points either!  
Please bring (or email) me the original assignment, plus a written explanation 
of your question or complaint, within <em>two weeks</em> of the time the paper 
in question is graded and returned to you.

  </li>

  <li> <H3><A name="academicintegrity">Academic Integrity</A></H3>

<p> In the context of this course, I encourage students to discuss general
course material, which includes studying for exams, sharing notes if a
student must miss class, and working on any practice problems which are
assigned.  We will also have occasional programming assignments that will
be completed in pairs.  However, unless clearly stated otherwise in the
assignment description, any work which will be submitted for a grade must
be completed by individuals.  In addition, the <b> only </b> acceptable
sources of information are the course textbook, the instructor, official
university tutors, or other sources which are explicitly mentioned in an
assignment.  Students may <b>not</b> use other sources, including (but not
limited to) websites other than the official course website or those
explicitly listed in course materials, textbooks other than those
officially listed below, or students (either past or present). </p>

<p> Students who violate academic integrity policies will be reported to 
the department.  First time offenses on homework will result in a minimum
of a failing grade on the assignment in question, with egregious or
repeated offenses resulting in failure in the course.  In addition,
students may be referred to the College of Arts and Sciences for further
disciplinary action.

    <p>The following is a statement of minimum standards for student 
academic integrity at Saint Louis University; I expect full compliance with
the policies described.</p>

Academic integrity is honest, truthful and responsible conduct in all academic endeavors. The mission of Saint Louis University is "the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity."  Accordingly, all acts of falsehood demean and compromise the corporate endeavors of teaching, research, health care, and community service via which SLU embodies its mission. The University strives to prepare students for lives of personal and professional integrity, and therefore regards all breaches of academic integrity as matters of serious concern.
 
The governing University-level Academic Integrity Policy was adopted in Spring 2015, and can be accessed on the Provost's Office website at: https://www.slu.edu/provost/policies/academic-and-course/policy_academic-integrity_6-26-2015.pdf. 
 
Additionally, each SLU College, School, and Center has adopted its own academic integrity policies, available on their respective websites.  All SLU students are expected to know and abide by these policies, which detail definitions of violations, processes for reporting violations, sanctions, and appeals.  Please direct questions about any facet of academic integrity to your faculty, the chair of the department of your academic program, or the Dean/Director of the College, School or Center in which your program is housed.

<A name="title9"><h3>Title IX</h3></A>

<p>Saint Louis University and its faculty are committed to supporting our students and seeking an environment that is free of bias, discrimination, and harassment. If you have encountered any form of sexual misconduct (e.g. sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, domestic or dating violence), we encourage you to report this to the University. If you speak with a faculty member about an incident of misconduct, that faculty member must notify SLU’s Title IX coordinator, Anna R. Kratky (DuBourg Hall, room 36;akratky@slu.edu; 314-977-3886) and share the basic facts of your experience with her. The Title IX coordinator will then be available to assist you in understanding all of your options and in connecting you with all possible resources on and off campus.

<p>If you wish to speak with a confidential source, you may contact the counselors at the University Counseling Center at 314-977-TALK. To view SLU’s sexual misconduct policy and for resources, please visit the following web addresses: www.slu.edu/here4you and https://www.slu.edu/general-counsel.

<A name="disabilities"><h3>Disability Services</h3></A>

<p>Students with a documented disability who wish to request academic accommodations must contact Disability Services to discuss accommodation requests and eligibility requirements. Once successfully registered, the student also must notify the course instructor that they wish to access accommodations in the course.

<p>Please contact Disability Services, located within the Student Success Center, at Disability_services@slu.edu or 314.977.3484 to schedule an appointment. Confidentiality will be observed in all inquiries. Once approved, information about the student’s eligibility for academic accommodations will be shared with course instructors via email from Disability Services and viewed within Banner via the instructor’s course roster.  

<p>Note: Students who do not have a documented disability but who think they may have one are encouraged to contact to Disability Services.


</LI>


<li>
<a name="children"><h3>Policy on Children in Class:</h3></a>

<p> For any student raising children, I understand that minor illnesses and
unforeseen disruptions in childcare often put parents in the position of having
to chose between missing class to stay home with a child and leaving him or her
with someone you or the child does not feel comfortable with. While this is not
meant to be a long-term childcare solution, occasionally bringing a child to
class in order to cover gaps in care is perfectly acceptable.

<p> All exclusively breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as is
necessary to support the breastfeeding relationship. Because not all women can
pump sufficient milk, and not all babies will take a bottle reliably, I never
want students to feel like they have to choose between feeding their baby and
continuing their education. You and your nursing baby are welcome in class
anytime.

<p>I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment that
is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in parenting
status. In all cases where babies and children come to class, I ask that you
sit close to the door so that if your little one needs special attention and is
disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until their need
has been met. Non-parents in the class, please reserve seats near the door for
your parenting classmates.

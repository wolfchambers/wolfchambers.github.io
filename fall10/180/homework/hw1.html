<a name="submit"><h3>Problems to be Submitted (20 points)</h3></a>


<p>
For this homework, we have created an almost perfect implementation of
a Television clas to model a typical television interface.  However
there are <b>five unrelated <em>syntactical</em> problems with our
source code</b>.
</P>

<p>
Your goal is to clearly identify the location and cause of those five
unrelated problems, and to explain succinctly how to remedy the
problems. Please be clear in distinguishing the five problems and
remedies, and identify precisely which line(s) of code
would need to be modified for each (based upon the original line
numbers).
</p>


<p>
Do not concern yourself with the chosen <em>semantics</em> for our
television model.  Though there may be criticisms of that model, this
assignment is focussing on the syntactical problems.
</p>


<p>
<b>To turn this assignment in, submit a hard copy of your answers, preferably typed.</b>   You are more than welcome to complete the
assignment purely based upon a visual examination of the original
source code, if the bugs are evident to you.   But we expect that the
real way to tackle this assignment will be to get a hold of the files
for yourself, try to compile and debug the original code, seeing if
the compiler error messages can help point you to the problems.
</p>


<hr>

<a name="files"><h3>Files You Will Need</h3></a>

<p>
The original sourcecode is located on <tt>turing</tt>.  You
may make a copy of the entire project, placing into your own working
directory, by executing the following.
<blockquote>
<pre>
cp -R /Public/goldwasser/180/homeworks/Television .
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>


<p>
Alternatively we offer:
<ul>
  <li>
      <a href="Television.pdf">A PDF of the source code, with
      line numbers</a>
  </li>
  <li>
      <a href="Television.cpp">Plain-text version of the source
      code, which could be cut/paste onto your own machine if you
      wish.
      </a>
  </li>
</ul>

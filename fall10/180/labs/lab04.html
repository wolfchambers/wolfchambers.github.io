<h1>Symmetric Order</h1>


<p>In your job at Albatross Circus Management (yes, it's run by a bunch of
  clowns), you have just finished writing a program whose output is a list
 of names in nondescending order by length (so that each name is at least
as long as the one preceding it). However, your boss does not like the way
the output looks, and instead wants the output to appear more symmetric, with
the shorter strings at the top and bottom and the longer strings in the middle.
His rule is that each pair of names belongs on opposite ends of the list,
and the first name in the pair is always in the top part of the list. In
the first example set below, Bo and Pat are the first pair, Jean and Kevin
the second pair, etc. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Input:</span> The input consists of one
 or more sets of strings, followed by a final  line containing only the value
 0. Each set starts with a line containing an  integer, <i>n</i>, which is
 the number of strings in the set, followed by  <i>n</i> strings, one per
line, sorted in nondescending order by length. None of the strings contain
spaces. There is at least one and no more than 15 strings per set.&nbsp;
Each string is at most 25 characters long.&nbsp; </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Output:</span> For each input set print
 "<span style="font-family: monospace;">SET</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span>"  on a line, where <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span> starts at 1, followed by the output
 set as shown in the  sample output. </p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
      <thead>  <tr>

<h1>Hints</h1>

<p>
The reordering of names can be solved in many ways, but it requires
some use of a container to store some names while others are being
printed.

<p>
For this lab, we want you to implement the following simple approach
using a stack.  For each set as you read the names in the input,
print the first name, push the second onto the stack, print the third
name, push the fourth onto the stack, and so on (making sure to
properly handle both even and odd-length lists).  Once you have
reached the end of the data set, empty the stack one element at a
time, printing each item and then popping it.

<p>
Its easy to see why this works by tracing through examples.  The first
pass of reading will result in outputting  the 1st, 3rd, 5th names,
and so on.  For example, in the first sample input, we will have
already printed Bo, Jean, Claude, and Marybeth.   The other names
(e.g., Pat, Kevin, William) are stored on the stack.  However, since a
stack provides last-in-first-out semantics, the order in which we
output these elements is the opposite of the original input order.
That is, William will be printed, then Kevin, then Pat.

<p>
Please use the C++ STL stack class, included in the library <tt>&lt;stack&gt;</tt>.
You can find <a
href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/stack/">online
documentation</a> regarding its usage.  Please keep in mind that this
is a templated class.  For this lab, you will be storing strings, so
you will need to declare your stack using a syntax such as
<pre>
stack&lt;string&gt; names;      // an initially empty stack
</pre>

<h1>Doubles</h1>

<p>
As part of an arithmetic competency program, your students will be given
randomly generated lists of from 2 to 15 unique positive integers and
asked to determine how many items in each list are twice some other item
in the same list.  You will need a program to help you with the grading.
This program should be able to scan the lists and output the correct
answer for each one. For example, given the list </p>
<center><pre>1 4 3 2 9 7 18 22</pre></center>
<p>
your program should answer 3, as 2 is twice 1, 4 is twice 2, and 18 is
twice 9. </p>
        
<p>
The input file will consist of one or more lists of numbers. There will be
one list of numbers per line.  Each list will contain from 2 to 15 unique
positive integers.  No integer will be larger than 99.
Each line will be terminated with the integer 0, which is not
considered part of the list.
A line with the single number -1 will
mark the end of the file.  The example input below shows 3 separate lists.
Some lists may not contain any doubles.</p>
        
<p>
The output will consist of one line per input list, containing
a count of the items that are double some other item.

<h1>Hints</h1>

<p>
This should be an easy one, but it requires a two-stage process for
each group.  First, we suggest having an array of boolean values that
can be used to "mark" which numbers are in the set.  After
initializing the array to be "empty" you can read the input and mark
each number in the set.    Once you have finished reading the group of
numbers, a loop through the array can be used to count how many times
a value and its double are in the set.

<p>
<b>Warnings:</b>
There are two common pitfalls to avoid
<ul>
  <li>
      Don't use illegal array indices.  Remember that C++ will not
      stop you from doing so;  instead, it will blindly access a part
      of memory that is not really the array.
  </li>
  <li>
      Make sure to reset your array for each new group.
      We do not want numbers from one trial to affect the next.
  </li>
</ul>
     

<h3>Pre-lab</h3>

What would the output be if the following was entered:<br>
<tt>
    1 2 4 8 16 32 0<br>
    2 4 6 8 10 0<br>
    -1</tt>

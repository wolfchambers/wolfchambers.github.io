<h1>Anagrams by Stack</h1>

<p>
Consider the use of a stack for reordering a
set of objects from one permutation (e.g.,&nbsp;<tt>abc</tt>) to
another (e.g.,&nbsp;<tt>bac</tt>) using the following rules.  The
characters are given with an initial order, and there is an
intermediate stack that is initially empty.  At each step, you may
either take the next character from the initial order (if any) and
push it onto the stack, or you may pop an item from the stack (if any), and place
it as the next character in the output string.

<p>
As an example, if you start with the sequence&nbsp;<tt>abc</tt>
you can achieve the result&nbsp;<tt>bac</tt> by
pushing&nbsp;<tt>a</tt>, pushing&nbsp;<tt>b</tt>,
popping&nbsp;<tt>b</tt>,
popping&nbsp;<tt>a</tt>,
pushing&nbsp;<tt>c</tt>, and finally popping&nbsp;<tt>c</tt>.
We can describe this sequence of maneuvers as <nobr><tt>++--+-</tt></nobr> where
each <tt>+</tt> designates a push and each <tt>-</tt> designates a
pop.


<p>
More generally, some inputs may not have any valid conversions while
others may have more than one valid sequence.
For example, it is impossible to go from <tt>abc</tt> to <tt>cab</tt>,
intuitively because the only way to get <tt>c</tt> as the first output
character would be to do three pushes followed by a pop; yet at that
time, <tt>b</tt> is above <tt>a</tt> on the stack and must be
retrieved next.
Yet there are two ways to go from <tt>aab</tt> to <tt>aba</tt>, either
as <nobr><tt>++-+--</tt></nobr> or <nobr><tt>+-++--</tt></nobr>.

<p>
You are to develop a program that computes all possible
sequences for converting one string to another using such rules.

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Input:</span>
The first line will be a value&nbsp;<em>1 &le; n &le; 100</em> denoting the number of
<em>pairs</em> to be considered. Following that will be <tt>n</tt>
lines, each containing two strings.  The first string designates the
starting sequence and the second the goal configuration.  The goal
string will always be the same length as the starting string, and
strings will have length at most 10.

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Output:</span>
For each case, an initial line should announce the initial and goal
strings, formatted as demonstrated below.  Following that should be a line
with the character&nbsp;<tt>[</tt>, followed by zero or more
lines detailing the solutions, followed by a
final line with the character&nbsp;<tt>]</tt>.
When there are multipel solutions, they should be presented in
lexicographically sorted order, with the
character <tt>+</tt> ordered before <tt>-</tt>.


<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
      <thead>  <tr>
       <td><b>Example input:</b></td>
        <td><b>Example output:</b></td>
      </tr>
      </thead>  <tbody>
      <tr>
       <td valign="top" style="font-family: monospace;">
4<br>

<h1>Hints</h1>

<p>
Use recursion to explore possible solutions to the problem. At any
intermediate stage, there are two possible continuations (if legal).
Try them both.  We used the following signature:
<pre>
/** Outputs, in sorted order, all solutions derivable from the given configuration */
void solve(string goal,      // the goal string
           string I,         // unused portion of "initial" string
           string S,         // current stack sequence
           string O,         // (partial) output string
           string moves      // '++-+-' style trace of moves thus far
          ) {
</pre>


<p>
We have intentionally chosen to use strings because they are
conveninent to duplicate and manipulate (
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/">
C++ string documentation</a>).  We have also intentionally tagged them
all as <tt>const</tt> in the signature so that you do not change their
state within a single recursive call (but you may create different
strings when invoking a further recursion).

<h1>Tracing a Recursion</h1>

To better understand (and debug) recursive processes, it helps to
generate a trace of a recursion.  As a simple example, for the case of
converting input "abc" to output "bac", the recursive processing based
on our parameterization should proceed as follows:
<pre>
solve(bca, abc, , , )
   solve(bca, bc, a, , +)
      solve(bca, c, ab, , ++)
         solve(bca, , abc, , +++)
            solve(bca, , ab, c, +++-)
               solve(bca, , a, cb, +++--)
                  solve(bca, , , cba, +++---)
         solve(bca, c, a, b, ++-)
            solve(bca, , ac, b, ++-+)
               solve(bca, , a, bc, ++-+-)
                  solve(bca, , , bca, ++-+--)
            solve(bca, c, , ba, ++--)
               solve(bca, , c, ba, ++--+)
                  solve(bca, , , bac, ++--+-)
      solve(bca, bc, , a, +-)
         solve(bca, c, b, a, +-+)
            solve(bca, , bc, a, +-++)
               solve(bca, , b, ac, +-++-)
                  solve(bca, , , acb, +-++--)
            solve(bca, c, , ab, +-+-)
               solve(bca, , c, ab, +-+-+)
                  solve(bca, , , abc, +-+-+-)
</pre>

<p>
For example, the initial call spawned another recursion based on
pushing "a" from the input onto the stack, thus
<nobr><tt>solve(bca, bc, a, , +)</tt></nobr>.
From that state, you will find two separate brances of recursion
develop, one for the action of pushing "b" onto the stack as the next
move (hence moves="<tt>++</tt>"), or another independent branch if we were instead to pop "a" from
the stack and place it on the output (hence moves="<tt>+-</tt>").
</p>

<p>
If you would like to produce this style of trace for your own program,
you may add the following debugging command just within the body of
your solve function:

<pre>
cout &lt;&lt; string(3*moves.size(),' ') &lt;&lt; "solve(" &lt;&lt; goal &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; I &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; S &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; O &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; moves &lt;&lt; ")" &lt;&lt; endl;
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Judge's Data</h2>
<p>
You can
<a href="../#testing">run the automated judge's tests on turing</a>
to test the correctness of your program (although you must still
formally submit the source code via the course website). If you are
working on your own machine (or if you just want to examine the
judge's inputs and expected outputs),
<a href="io.html">we provide them here</a>.

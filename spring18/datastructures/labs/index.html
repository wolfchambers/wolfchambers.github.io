  <h3><a name="icpc">ACM's International Collegiate Programming Contest</a></h3>
  <p>
  This year, each of our lab assignments will be a problem taken from
  a past offering of the ACM International Collegiate Programming
  Contest (ICPC).  Students work in teams of three to solve as many
  problems as possible in a five-hour time period. 

  <p>
  Hundreds of regional contests are held each Fall, involving
  thousands of teams across the world.  The top 100 teams from the
  regionals qualify for the World Finals held in the Spring.
  More information can be found on the <a
  href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/">official ICPC site</a>.
  Also, if you have any interest in participating on
  <a href="/~goldwasser/icpc">SLU's teams</a>, please let me know next
  Fall.
  
  
  <h3><a name="format">General Problem Format</a></h3>

  <p>
  Each problem is computational in nature, with the goal being to
  compute a specific output based on some input parameters. 
  Each problem defines a clear and unambigous form for the expected input
  and desired output.  Relevant bounds on the size of the input
  are clearly specified. To be successful, the program must complete
  within 60 seconds on the given machine (thus, efficiency can be
  important for certain problems).

  <p>
  Each problem description offers a handful of sample inputs and the
  expected output for those trials as a demonstration.  Behind the
  scene, the judges often have hundreds of additional tests.
  Submitted programs are "graded" by literally running them on all of
  the judges' tests, capturing the output, and comparing whether the
  output is identical (character-for-character) to the expected output.

  <p>
  If the test is successful, the team gets credit for completing the
  problem.  If the test fails, the team is informed of the failure and
  allowed to resubmit (with a slight penalty applied).  However, the
  team receives very little feedback from the judges.  In essence,
  they are told that it failed but given no explanation as to the
  cause of the problem, or even the data set that leads to the
  problem.

  <p>
  Actually, the feedback is slightly more informative. Upon submitting a
  program, the team formally receives one of the following responses:
  <ul>
    <li>
	<p>
	<b>Success</b>
    </li>
    <li>
	<p>
	<b>Submission Error</b>
	<br>
	This is reported if the submitted program does not properly
	compile, is not properly named, or is clearly an attempt at a
	different problem.
    </li>
    <li>
	<p>
	<b>Run-time Error</b>
	<br>
	This is reported if the program crashes during execution.
    </li>
    <li>
	<p>
	<b>Wrong Answer</b>
	<br>
	This designates that the program ran to completion, but the
	content of the output does not match the expected results.
    </li>
    <li>
	<p>
	<b>Presentation Error</b>
	<br>
	In spirit, there are some cases where the students got the
	wrong output not because their computations were wrong, but
	due to a superficial problem in formatting their output.  This
	can occur if they misspell words, use incorrect or missing
	punctuation, capitalize incorrectly, use too few or too many
	spaces or extra blank lines, or present the wrong number of
	significant digits in numeric output.
    </li>
  </ul>

  
  <h3><a name="conventions">Important Conventions</a></h3>

  <p>
  Because of the automated nature of the judging, it is important that
  programs follow these conventions:

  <ul>
    <li>
	<p>
	The source code solving a problem must be self-contained in a
	single file.
    </li>
    <li>
	<p>
	Each problem statement will clearly designate a precise
	filename that must be used for the source code
	(e.g., <tt>copier.cpp</tt>).
    </li>
    <li>
	<p>
	Please put a comment at the top of your source code indicating
	the names of the contributing team members.
    </li>
    <li>
	<p>
	All input should be read from standard input (i.e., using
	<tt>cin</tt> in C++).
    </li>
    <li>
	<p>
	All output should be written to standard output (i.e., using
	<tt>cout</tt> in C++).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  Please note as well that the format of most problems is designed so
  that judges can specify multiple tests as part of a single
  execution.  Typically this is done by having an input format where
  initial parameters are read, using a special value (such as 0 or #)
  to designate the end of the trials.  Therefore, most programs will
  need to iterate through multiple trials using an outer loop. It is
  also important that relevant data structures be initialized for each
  trial, so that earlier trials do not affect later ones.
  
  
  <h3><a name="testing">Testing Your Implementation</a></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
	<p>
	<b>Testing on your own</b>
	<br>
	Since each problem specification includes at least a few
	sample cases of input and the expected output, there is no
	reason to submit your program to the judges until you are
	confident that it succeeds on those sample inputs.
	<p>
	Although the program is formally written to to accept input
	from standard input, it can be quite tiring (not to mention,
	error-prone) to have to type the test input each time you want
	to run your program.  For some problems, the test input is
	also quite large.
	<p>
	It is possible to redirect input from a text file to the
	standard input without needing to rewrite your source code.
	On our system, this can be done with the following syntax:
	<pre>
	./myProgram < myInput.txt
	</pre>
	This behaves just as if someone were to type the characters
	from the file <tt>myInput.txt</tt> on the keyboard while the
	program executes.
    </li>
    <li>
	<p>
	<b>Testing on judge's data (on turing)</b>
	<br>
	When you have the program working on the sample data and you
	wish to test it on the judges hidden data, you may execute the
	following command from your turing account.
	<pre>
	/public/chambers/180/labs/judge myProgram.cpp
	</pre>
	(of course, using the actual name of the source code file).
	Our automated program is not quite as professional as the
	real judges, but it will do.  In particular it does not
	automatically terminate after 60 seconds elapse.  In fact, it
	never terminates.  It will tell you when it starts executing.
	If too much time has passed, you may press cntr-C to kill the
	process yourself.
	<p>
	Also, a correct distinction between "wrong output" and
	"presentation error" is difficult to automate. We've made a
	decent attempt to look for common presentation errors, but in
	case of doubt, we will report it as a "wrong output".
    </li>
    <li>
	<p>
	<b>Testing on judge's data (web-based)</b>
	<br>
	If you get really competitive, there is an official website
	that archives all of the past ICPC problems and allows you to
	submit your source code on their system.  They also keep track
	of statistics and have a leaderboard available for those who
	have the most efficient solutions for a given problem.
	The site is at <nobr><a
	href="http://cii-judge.baylor.edu/">http://cii-judge.baylor.edu/</a></nobr>.
	
	<p>
	In order to submit attempts on that website, you must register
	and get an ID used for tracking.  You should also be aware
	that the compiler that they use on that system is not
	necessarily configured the same as our on turing.  So it is
	possible that you have code that compiles and executes
	properly on turing, but which results in a compile error on
	this website.  If this happens, you may indicate that you want
	to receive the full compile errors in an email message.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3><a name="submit">Formal Submission</a></h3>

  <p>
Although the online tools give you a way to test your
implementation, <b>you must submit to the instructor via email</a> in order to get credit for the lab</b>.  Please
keep in mind that we will award half-credit for any sincere attempt at a lab, even if you are unable to succeed with the automated testing.  However, you will get zero credit if you do not ever submit your attempt.
  
  <p>  
  Also, make sure to include the names of all team members in comments at
  the top of the submit source code.

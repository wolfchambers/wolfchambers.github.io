<h1>Tree Grafting 2</h1>


<p>

Trees have many applications in computer science. Perhaps the most commonly
used trees are rooted binary trees, but there are other types of rooted
trees that may be useful as well. One example is ordered trees, in
which the subtrees for any given node are ordered. The number of
children of each node is variable, and there is no limit on the number.
Formally, an ordered tree consists of a finite set of nodes T such that

<ul>
<li> there is one node designated as the root, denoted root(T);<br></li>
<li> the remaining nodes are partitioned into subsets T1, T2, ..., Tm, each of which is also a tree (subtrees).</li>
</ul>

Also, define root(T1), ..., root(Tm) to be the children of root(T), with
root(Ti) being the i-th child. The nodes root(T1), ..., root(Tm) are
siblings.

<p>It is often more convenient to represent an ordered
tree as a rooted binary tree, so that each node can be stored in the
same amount of memory. The conversion is performed by the following
steps:

<ol>
<li>remove all edges from each node to its children;</li>
<li>for each node, add an edge to its first child in T (if any) as the left child;</li>
<li>for each node, add an edge to its next sibling in T (if any) as the right child.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is illustrated by the following:
<blockquote><pre>
         0                             0
       / | \                          /
      1  2  3       ===&gt;             1
        / \                           \
       4   5                           2
                                      / \
                                     4   3
                                      \
                                       5
</pre></blockquote>
In most cases, the height of the tree (the number of edges in the longest
root-to-leaf path) increases after the conversion. This is undesirable
because the complexity of many algorithms on trees depends on its
height.

<p>You are asked to write a program that computes the height of the tree before and after the conversion.


<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is given by a number of lines giving the directions taken
in a depth-first traversal of the trees. There is one line for each
tree.  For example, the tree above would give dudduduudu, meaning 0
down to 1, 1 up to 0, 0 down to 2, etc. The input is terminated by a
line whose first character is #. You may assume that each tree has at
least 2 and no more than 10000 nodes.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each tree, print the heights of the tree before and after the
conversion specified above.  Use the format:
<blockquote><pre>
Tree t: h1 =&gt; h2
</pre></blockquote>
where t is the case number (starting from 1), h1 is the height of the
tree before the conversion, and h2 is the height of the tree after the
conversion.

<h1>Hints</h1>

<p>
Upon first glance, this problem seems like it's going to require you
to build a tree data structure and then implement the conversion from
the general tree to the binary tree.   But as is the case with many of
these contest problems, there's a much easier way.

<p>
It is possible to compute the resulting depths without ever building
the trees.  We suggest a recursive approach.  In the end we want a
function that can compute the depth of the entire tree;  we will
design a recursion that computes the depth of any subtree.  Consider
the following local view:
<br>
<img src="view.gif">
<br>
If you were told the traditional depths for each of the four children,
can you compute the traditional depth of the larger subtree?   
Consider the "converted" case.  If you were told the "converted" depth
for each of the four children, can you determine the converted depth
for the larger subtree?


<p>
Here is how we recommend setting up the recursion.  Remember that the
original input is just a sequence of 'd' and 'u' designators to
describe the shape of the tree.   We want to think about starting the
recursion at the root.  Technically, there is no 'd'/'u' pair in the
input for going down to the root up up from it, but for consistency
sake, <b><em>we recommend that you alter the original input string by adding
a preceding 'd' and a trailing 'u'.</em></b>
</p>

<p>
There are several strategies you might use in order to compute BOTH
versions of the depth. One is to have two separate recrusive functions
<pre>
int originalDepth(string::iterator&amp; i);
int modifiedDepth(string::iterator&amp; i);
</pre>
and then call each of them from within main (although note well that
you will need to reset the iterator to the beginning of the string
before the second call).  Given that we are in "contest mode" and just
want to get this done, two separate functions is permissible.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the two functions will have almost the same logic in the
way that parse the string and make recursive calls. The only
difference is in how they use the information gathered about the
children in determining their defined height. A slight improvement in
design would be to code the function once, using an extra boolean
parameter to denote which version of the logic you want to use.
<pre>
int depth(string::iterator&amp; i, bool converted);
</pre>
With this design, you only need to code the core logic once, with some
care to denote how the height calculation is done based on the
boolean. But from within main, you will still need to call the
function twice (once with coverted=false and once with converted=true).
</p>

<p>
The idea design would be to have a single function that simultaneously
computes BOTH definitions of height during the same run, so that the
string is only parsed once. Such a function can be coded with the signature
<pre>
pair&lt;int,int&gt; depth(string::iterator&amp; i);
</pre>
so that the function is tasked with returning a <em>pair</em> of
integers to represent the two notions of height. Similarly, each
recursive call will be tasked with returning the pair of integers
representing its subtree. See documentation for the C++ <a
href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/utility/pair">pair</a> class
for more technical details; that class is quite useful for experienced
C++ programmers.

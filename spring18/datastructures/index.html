<h3> Announcements: </h3>
<ul>

<li><p> Thursday, May 3: I have added homework 5 grades to blackboard.  Note that there were a number of 0's that may be due to git issues, so please check your grade and the rubric in your git repo and let me know if you spot any issues.

<li><p> Thursday, May 3: In case you missed the multiple email
reminders, the class assessment form is now open.  Please take 5 minutes
to go leave feedback on the course, so I can hopefully improve it in the
future!

<li><p> May 1: The <a href="hw11.pdf">final review sheet</a> has been posted.  One of these questions will appear on your final exam.  (No, I will not give you solutions for these problems!)

<li><p> April 25: <a href="homework/homework10.html">Homework 10</a> is available; it will be due next Wednesday, 5/2, by 11:59pm.  Note that you are welcome to work with a partner on this one.

<li><p> April 10: I'm going to cancel lecture tomorrow, Wednesday April 11.  I'll be in and plan to do office hours, for those that have questions on homework, lab, or midterm.  The sample midterms are in my office, so feel free to swing by today or tomorrow during class time to pick one up.  (If my office gets full, I'll head down to the classroom from 9-10 to make sure we have space, so look for me there if I'm not in my office.)

<li><p> April 10: Since the midterm is Monday, you are welcome to submit lab 9 next week.  Lab 10 is posted; it is officially due on the 27th, so you'll have two in class work days.  Note that I think you'll need these - this is probably the most challenging lab I assign, so I'm hoping the extra time and having subs here while I'm gone with help make the lab more manageable. 

<li><p> March 27: Apologies, but I had a bug in the posted makefile.  I have updated it, so you can download or repull from the git repo.  Note that this makefile should work for both homeworks 8 and 9 - just type "make AVL" or "make BST", depending on which version you want to run, and it will generate either testAVL or testBST for you.

<li><p> March 26: I have posted both <a href="homework/homework8.html">homework 8</a> and <a 
href="homework/homework9.html">homework 9</a>.  Both can be done in pairs; homework 8 is due on April 3 by 11:59pm and 
homework 9 on April 12 by 11:59pm.

<li><p> March 26: The second midterm will take place on Monday, April 16; we'll have a review session the Friday before in class.

<li><p> March 19: <a href="homework/hw7.pdf">Homework 7</a> is now available.  It is due next Monday, 3/26, by the start of class (handed in on paper, preferably).

<li><p> March 16: Due to a discrepency between lecture notes and what I originally posted, I'll extend the due date on <a href="homework/hw6.pdf">Homework 6</a> slightly.  It is now due by Monday, March 19, at 11:59pm.  Apologies for any confusion, and I hope you all are having a wonderful spring break!

<li><p> March 2: <a href="homework/hw6.pdf">Homework 6</a> is now available.  It will be due on Sunday, March 18, by midnight; please submit via git.  (Note that I will also be traveling over break, so you are strongly advised to start next week and email me questions early if possible!)

<li><p> Feb. 26: Extra credit opportunity: To earn back some points missed on the midterm, you are welcome to code a solution to problem 6 from the midterm (the function halves).  You should also code a main that sets up the example I showed in a queue, and call your function to prove that it works.  Submit your function and main in a single cpp file via git, in a folder that clearly indicates it is the extra credit midterm question.

<li><p> Feb. 26: Midterm 1 is graded; the scores are on blackboard, or you can stop by my office hours to pick up your graded exam.

<li><p>Feb. 23: <a href="homework/hw5.pdf">Homework 5</a> is now available.  It will be due next Friday, March 2, by 11:59pm; this one must be completed individually.

<li><p> Feb. 9: As announced today, the first midterm will be on Tuesday, Feb. 20, with a review session in class the day before.  Please come prepared with questions, and let me know if we need to work out any accomidations for the exam on Tuesday by early next week.

<li><p> Feb. 9: <a href="homework/homework4.html">Homework 4</a> is available; it will be due next Friday, 
Feb. 16, by midnight.  Note: you may work with a partner on this one!  If you choose to do so, only one of 
you needs to submit via git; please clearly indicate the two names in the readme that 
is required, so that you will both get credit.

<li><p> Feb. 8: For homework 3, please be sure your code works for a non-integer list, i.e. a list of strings or booleans or doubles. You also do need to check all the functions, including the = one, in your main, and for best results test them a few different ways!

<li><p> Feb. 2: I have just updated and finished the SLinkedList class; it is available from the course webpage as well as in the course git repo.  (You can get the course repo by doing the following at a command prompt: "git clone git@git.cs.slu.edu:courses/spring18/csci2100/course", with no quotes.)

<li><p> Feb. 1: <a href="homework/hw3.pdf">Homework 3</a> is available.  It will be due by 11:59pm next Friday, Feb. 9, via git.

<li><p> Jan. 20: Apologies, but there is a bug on homework 2.  The first line of Problem 1b should read: *b = 'X'.  Apologies for the typo!

<li><p> Jan. 25: <a href="homework/hw2.pdf">Homework 2</a> is available.  It will be due next Thursday, Feb. 1, by 11:59pm.  (Note that you may submit the written part of it either through git or on paper; just drop it in my office before the due date if you want to turn in a paper copy.)

<li><p> Jan. 25: Note that office hours have changed; my Wednesday hours have moved to Friday for the rest of the semester.

<li><p> Jan. 25: For anyone with lingering git issues or lab questions, I'll be in my office today (Thursday) from 2 to 3:30pm; feel free to stop by if it would be helpful.

<li><p> Jan. 24: A note on the labs: from here on out, all will be due via git.  Please create a lab2 folder for this one, put copier.cpp in the folder, and commit using git (same process as the homework).  Note that it MUST work via the judging program to get full credit - be sure you cin, etc., as described in the <a href="labs/index.html">lab overview</a>.

<li><p> Jan. 23: The <a href="git_student.pdf">git student guide</a> is now available; we'll go over this in class today.

<li><p> Jan 22: Just a reminder that lab 2 will be tomorrow - it will be posted on the lab page by this afternoon, and the prelab is due via email to me BEFORE 9am tomorrow.  No credit is given for late prelabs!

<li><p> Jan 17: For lab 1 (located on the labs section), the appropriate files are in /public/chambers/lab1, not in the directory I had initially listed.  I've updated the link in the lab description, so you should be able to copy and paste commands from there now.  Don't forget that this is due via email on Friday, before midnight.

<li><p> Jan. 15: <a href="homework/hw1.pdf">The first homework</a> is now available; it will be due next Friday, Jan. 22, by 11:59pm.  Note that this homework must be done individually, and should be submitted via email to both me and the grader (whose email is given in the homework).

<li><p> Jan. 15: <a href="python2cpp.pdf">Here</a> is a link to the transition guide we will be using as a reference for the first 2-3 weeks of the class.  

<li> <p> Welcome to data structures!  Please make sure to read the course 
policies carefully, and remember to check this announcements section 
daily for new announcements or reminders.

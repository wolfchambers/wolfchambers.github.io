  <li> <h3><a name="regrades">Regrade Requests</a></h3>

	<p> I am happy to regrade any assignments, programs, quizzes or exam problems which you 
think were unfair or incorrect.  Please bring me the original assignment, plus a written 
explanation of your question or complaint, within <em>two weeks</em> of the time the paper in 
question is graded and returned to you.

  </li>

  <li> <H3><A name="academicintegrity">Academic Integrity</A></H3>

<p> In the context of this course, I encourage students to discuss general course material, which
includes studying for exams, sharing notes if a student must miss class, and working on any practice
problems which are assigned.  We will also have occasional programming assignments that will be 
completed in pairs.  However, unless clearly stated otherwise in the assignment description, 
any work which will be submitted for a grade must
be completed by individuals.  In addition, the  <b> only </b> acceptable sources of information
are the course textbook, the instructor, official university tutors, or other sources which are 
explicitly mentioned in an assignment.  Students may <b>not</b> use other sources, including
(but not limited to) websites other than the official course website or those explicitly listed
in course materials, textbooks other than those officially listed below, or
students (either past or present). </p>

<p> Students who violate academic integrity policies will be reported to the department.  First time
offenses on homework will result in a minimum of a failing grade on the assignment in question, with
egregious or repeated offenses resulting in failure in the course.  In addition, students may be
referred to the College of Arts and Sciences for further disciplinary action.

    <p>The following is a statement of minimum standards for student academic integrity at Saint Louis University; I expect full compliance with the policies described.</p>

<p>The University is a community of learning, whose effectiveness requires an environment of mutual trust and integrity, such as would be expected at a Jesuit, Catholic institution. As members of this community, students, faculty, and staff members share the responsibility to maintain this environment. Academic dishonesty violates it. Although not all forms of academic dishonesty can be listed here, it can be said in general that soliciting, receiving, or providing any unauthorized assistance in the completion of any work submitted toward academic credit is dishonest. It not only violates the mutual trust necessary between faculty and students, but also undermines the validity of the Universityï¿½s evaluation of students and takes unfair advantage of fellow students.</p>

<p>Further, it is the responsibility of any student who observes such dishonest conduct to call it to the attention of a faculty member or administrator.</p>

<p>Examples of academic dishonesty would be copying from another student, copying from a book or class notes during a closed-book exam, submitting materials authored by or editorially revised by another person but presented as the studentï¿½s own work, copying a passage or text directly from a published source without appropriately citing or recognizing that source, taking a test or doing an assignment or other academic work for another student, tampering with another studentï¿½s work, securing or supplying in advance a copy of an examination without the knowledge or consent of the instructor, and colluding with another student or students to engage in an act of academic dishonesty.</p>

<p>Where there is clear indication of such dishonesty, a faculty member or administrator has the responsibility to apply appropriate sanctions. Investigations of violations will be conducted in accord with standards and procedures of the school or college through which the course or research is offered. Recommendations of sanctions to be imposed will be made to the dean of the school or college in which the student is enrolled. Possible sanctions for a violation of academic integrity include, but are not limited to, disciplinary probation, suspension, and dismissal from the University. </p>

    <p>Any student who feels that he or she may need academic accomidations in order to meet the
      requirements of this course, as outlined in the syllabus, due to the presence of a disability, 
      should contact the Student Success Center.  Please call the office at (314)977-8885, send an 
      email to meyerah@slu.edu, or visit the Student Success Center on the 3rd floor of the Busch

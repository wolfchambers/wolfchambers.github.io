<h3> Announcements: </h3>
<ul>

<li><p>May 4: <a href="finalreview.pdf">Here</a> is the review sheet for 
the final exam, covering all the topics since the midterm.  Please note 
that you are also reponsible for material that was covered on the 
midterm also, as well as more technical material that was covered in the lab.

<li><p>May 3: Class is canceled for today (Tuesday).  We'll meet as usual on Thursday, and the final paper is still due then.

<li><p>May 2: Office hours are cancelled today due to a sick child.
Please email with any questions.

<li><p> April 27: The final analysis paper will be on computer forensics.  You are required to read TWO papers in the following <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usab5601.pdf">document</a>, one of which must be the first article which is an introduction to computer forensics.  The paper is in the usual format, and the final version is due next Thursday, May 4.

<li><p>April 14:  There are two assignments due next Tuesday in class.  One is the "good faith" paper about the ethics of the recent events surrounding geohot and the lawsuit that Sony filed against him.  The other is a reading assignment; please be sure to finish the required reading for lab 5 by the start of class on Tuesday.

<li><p>April 13: <a href="assignments/lab05.html">Lab 5</a> is available; it will be due on April 27, with a checkpoint due on April 21.  There are 3 exercises included, but you are only required to complete 2 of the 3 exercises.  If you wish to do all 3, the third will be graded as extra credit.  Please make sure to read the introduction to the lab by next Tuesday!

<li><p>April 10: I will need to leave my office hours early tomorrow, so I will only be in my office from 1:30-2:30 (instead of staying until 3:30).  Please email me to set up another time if you are unable to make this time.

<li><p>March 28: <a href="assignments/lab04.html">Lab 4</a> is available.  It will be due on April 13, by 11:59pm.  (This one might take you a bit longer, so please start early!)

<li><p>March 28: The writeup for the second reading assignment, "No-Tech Hacking", will be due on Thursday, March 31, at the start of class. 

<li><p>March 21: Several people have mentioned having trouble gathering useful statistics from tcpdump.  I'd suggested a few different ways, but finally think that a script is the most useful way to do this.  <a href="conDur.pl">Here</a> is a sample perl script that may be useful for calculation connection durations.  (This is based heavily on which type of machine you are using, so there may be some issues depending on type of node you are swapped in as.)  
Run it like this (tcpfile is the output of <tt>tcpdump</tt> in binary format):
<pre>
conDur.pl tcpfile | sort -g -k 1
</pre>
Feel free to use another method if you prefer.
<br>Given that some people are having issues with this last data analysis portion, I'll grant an extra 24 hours (until Tuesday, March 22, at 11:59pm) to anyone who wants to use some extra time.

<li><p>March 4: <a href="assignments/lab03.html">Lab 3</a> is now posted; it is due next Friday, March 11.

<li><p>Feb. 24: <a href="mt1review.pdf">Here</a> is the review sheet for the midterm, which will be in class next Thursday, March 3.

<li><p>Feb. 11: There are 2 reading assignments for next Tuesday.  First, please 
read <a href="assignments/lab02.html">lab 2</a> before our next class; the lab 
itself will be due on Tuesday, Feb. 22.  Second, please read <a 
href="schedule/gutmann.pdf">"Lessons Learned in Implementing and Deploying Crypto 
Software"</a>, a paper on the realities of cryptography.  We will discuss both of 
these in our next meeting on Tuesday, Feb. 15.

<li><p>Feb. 3: <a href="assignments/DETERintro.pdf">Here</a> is a pdf copy of our getting started with DETER handout, for your future reference.

<li><p>Jan 31:  Please read the "required reading" section of <a href="assignments/lab01.html">lab 1</a> before class on Thursday.  (Note that you will probably have a quiz over that material, so make sure you do it before class begins!)

<li><p>Jan 31:  All classes tomorrow have been canceled at SLU.  Please email your paper summary to me by 12:45 tomorrow, and bring your partner review sheet to submit on Thursday.  

<li><p> Welcome to CS493!  Please be sure to read course policies carefully, and check this page 
daily for updates or announcements.

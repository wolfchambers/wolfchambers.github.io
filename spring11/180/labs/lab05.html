<h1>Symmetric Order (again)</h1>


<p>In your job at Albatross Circus Management (yes, it's run by a bunch of
  clowns), you have just finished writing a program whose output is a list
 of names in nondescending order by length (so that each name is at least
as long as the one preceding it). However, your boss does not like the way
the output looks, and instead wants the output to appear more symmetric, with
the shorter strings at the top and bottom and the longer strings in the middle.
His rule is that each pair of names belongs on opposite ends of the list,
and the first name in the pair is always in the top part of the list. In
the first example set below, Bo and Pat are the first pair, Jean and Kevin
the second pair, etc. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Input:</span> The input consists of one
 or more sets of strings, followed by a final  line containing only the value
 0. Each set starts with a line containing an  integer, <i>n</i>, which is
 the number of strings in the set, followed by  <i>n</i> strings, one per
line, sorted in nondescending order by length. None of the strings contain
spaces. There is at least one and no more than 15 strings per set.&nbsp;
Each string is at most 25 characters long.&nbsp; </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Output:</span> For each input set print
 "<span style="font-family: monospace;">SET</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span>"  on a line, where <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n</span> starts at 1, followed by the output
 set as shown in the  sample output. </p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
      <thead>  <tr>

<h1>Hints</h1>

<p>
Look familiar?  Yes, we already solved this problem two weeks ago when
using stacks.  At that time, I described a bizarre way that worked by
printing one, pushing the next to a stack, printing the third, pushing
the fourth and so on.  Although that approach worked, I can all but
guarantee that not a single team would have bothered to solve it that
way.

<p>
This problem can be solved quite easily with a vector.  Start by
reading all the strings into a vector, using the given order.  Then,
to get the output in the desired order, write one loop to print out
all elements of the vector that have even index (i.e., v[0], v[2],
v[4], ...).   Then write a second loop that starts at the end moving
backward while printing all items that have an odd index (i.e., v[5],
v[3], v[1]).   The only care needed is to ensure that your loops execute
the correct number of iterations.


<p>
So for today's lab, please redo this problem, this time using the
std::vector class of the 
<tt>&lt;vector&gt;</tt> library.  If you need a reminder, you can find
<a
href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/vector/vector.html">online
documentation</a> regarding its usage.  But its essentially an array
that resizes as you push things to the back.

<h3>Pre-lab</h3>

No pre-lab this week, since it's the same as the last lab.

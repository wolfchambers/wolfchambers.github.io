<H1><A NAME="overview">Overview and Task</A></H1>

<P> For this assignment, you must implement the remove method for 
the Binary Search Tree class.  The general idea was covered 
in class, and you may refer to lecture notes or the text book for 
assistance. </p>

<p>To implement remove, you will first use the find function to see if 
the value is in the list.  If it is, there are several cases to consider.</p>

<p>  Say that your value is in node x.  If x
 is a leaf, you can simply delete it (using helper functions from 
BinaryTree.h).  If x has only 1 child, you can delete it and promote that 
child while maintaining a binary search tree property.  However, if it 
has two children, you need to find the next node in an inorder traveral.  
Call this node y.  If y is a leaf, you swap the value into x's position 
and then delete the leaf node that contained y.  If it is not a leaf, it 
must have only a right child (since the left child would come first in an 
inorder traversal), so you can delete y, promote its right child, and 
still put y's value into x's node.</p>

<p>For this assignment, you are welcome to implement any helper functions 
you need - just be careful to put them in a protected or private setting 
if they are not something an end user should have access to.  More 
likely, you will want to use the functions provided in BinaryTree.h, both 
for the tree and for iterators. </p>

<p>Note: For simplicity, we are assuming that your trees will only store 
distinct elements.  So if a value is inserted twice, you do not need to 
have it represented twice in your tree.  You DO need to handle this case 
without crashing, however! </P>

<H1><A NAME="debug">Debugging Your Program</A></H1>

<p> Write a function called TestBinaryTree.cpp which creates a binary 
search tree and performs inserts and removes on the tree.  
You are welcome to use the draw function (inherited from BinaryTree.h) to 
draw your tree at each step and debug your code. </p>

<p>Again, feel free to write other test functions - such as a function 
that prints the height of a node, or an inorder traversal of the tree - 
if that is helpful for your debugging process. </p>

All such files can be <a href="p4/">downloaded here</a>.

      <P>
      <tt>BinaryTree.h</tt> and <tt>BinarySearchTree.h</TT>
      <BR>
      These are the implementations of the Binary Tree and Binary Search
Tree, from our work in class.
      <p>
      Note:  For the sake of simplicity, we did not bother to separate
      out the function bodies for the class into a separate
      cpp files.  All the function bodies are embeded
      directly into the header.  You should make your changes directly
      to the .h file as well.

      <P>
      <TT>makefile</TT>
      <BR>
      This makefile should allow  you to rebuild your project by
      simply typing 'make' rather than in invoking the compiler
      directly.

      Submit your revised <tt>BinarySearchTree.h</tt> files. Note that you should not need to alter BinaryTree.h, so please let me know if you make any changes there (and explain why they are needed)!

      A sample program that creates a binary search tree and walks through 
a set operations, checking that inserting and removing elements works.

<H1><A NAME="grading">Grading Standards</A></H1>

<P>
The assignment is worth <em>10</em> points. 

One point will be awarded for an early checkpoint on next Friday, April 
15, at which point we expect to see an initial draft of your remove function.

Your test file will be worth 1 point.

The remaining 8 points will be given for working remove code in both tree 
classes. </P>

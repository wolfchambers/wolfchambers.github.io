<h2>Homework Assignment 5

</h2>
<h3>Trees and Heaps</h3>
</center>

<a name="submit"><h3>Problems to be Submitted (30 points)</h3></a>

<ol type = "A"> 

  <LI> (8 points)
      <P>      
Assume that we start with an initially empty heap, and that items are
      inserted with the following sequence of integer keys:
      <blockquote>
      insert(20), insert(7), insert(8), insert(5), insert(12), insert(11),
      insert(6), insert(18), insert(14), insert(3), insert(4), insert(13).
      </blockquote>
      Using Figure&nbsp;8.3 as a guide for style, draw the heap which results at
      the very end of the last operation.
      </P>
      <P>
      <b>Note:</b> for this problem we are <u>not</u> requiring you to show
      any of the work along the way, though you may if you wish.  Please do
      be careful to follow the exact sequence given and to double-check your
      work.
      </P>
  </LI>

  <LI> (2 points)
      <P>
      In class, we wrote an array based implementation of heaps. Please draw the contents of an array which represents the tree <em>T</em> you gave in your answer
      to Problem&nbsp;A.
      </P>
  </LI>

  <LI> (5 points)
   <p> 
    Now draw the heap that results after the operation removeMax() is called on your heap from Problem A.
  </LI>

   <LI> (5 points)
       <P>
       A certain Professor CrazyBeard claims that a preorder traversal of a heap will list out the elements of the heap in sorted order, in the same way that binary search trees work.  Draw a (small) example of a heap that proves him wrong.
   </LI>


  <LI> (5 points)
      <P>
      For the tree in Figure&nbsp;7.11 (on page&nbsp;285), what order will nodes be visited
      during a <u>preorder</u> traversal?

  </LI>

  <LI> (10 points)
      <P>
      Draw a (proper) binary tree <em>T</em> such that
      simultaneously,
      <ul>
	<LI> each node of <em>T</em> stores a single character</LI>
	<LI> a <em>preorder</em> traversal of <em>T</em> yields <tt>BIGZANYCOMPUTER</tt></LI>
	<LI> an <em>inorder</em> traversal of <em>T</em> yields <tt>GIAZNBCYPMTUEOR</tt></LI>
      </ul>

  <LI> (5 points) 
       <p> Insert, into an initially empty binary search tree, items with the following 
keys (in this order): 33, 40, 24, 58, 49, 20, 63,  25, 11, 13.  Draw the final tree 
after that order of insertions.  (Again, you may wish to show your work along 
the way.)

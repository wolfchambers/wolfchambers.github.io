<H1><A NAME="overview">Overview</A></H1>

<P>
Web browsers commonly allow you to navigate through a "history" of
web pages that have previously been visited.  The mechanism is
somewhat like a stack, in that the most recently visited pages are at
the top of the history and revisited when the "back" button is
pressed. 


<P>
However, the history does not necessarily have unbounded capacity.
In reality, there may exist a fixed limit on the size of the
history.  The issue arises as to what should happen when the capacity
is exhausted and a new item is pushed onto the stack.  One possibility
is to throw an exception.
But this is not how a Web browser behaves.  If it only has room to save
<em>50</em> pages in its history and yet you visit more pages, it will
make room in the history for a new page by throwing away the page
that is on the very bottom of the history (i.e., the least recently
visited page).  The formal <TT>Stack</TT> interface does not help, as
it gives us no way to directly access or remove the object on the
bottom of the stack.

<P>
In this assignment, we define a new ADT that we call a
<TT>LeakyStack</TT>.  The interface for a <TT>LeakyStack</TT> is very
similar to the interface given for a <TT>Stack</TT>. However in the
case when the capacity is exhausted, a call to <TT>push</TT> will
result in the placement of the new page at the expense of the loss of
the least recently accessed page.  We formalize this interface as an
abstract class definition, provided online in file
<TT>LeakyStack.h</TT>.

<PRE>
/**
 * Interface for a leaky stack: A collection of objects that are inserted
 * and removed according to the last-in first-out principle, but with
 * overflow handled by the removal of the least-recently accessed item.
 */
class LeakyStack {
 public:
  /** Returns the number of objects in the stack.
   *  @return number of elements
   */
  int size() const;

  /** Determines if the stack is currently empty.
   *  @return true if empty, false otherwise.
   */
  bool empty() const;

  /** Returns a const reference to the top object in the stack.
   *  Throws a runtime_error if the stack is empty.
   * @return reference to top element
   */
  const string& top() const;

  /** Inserts an object at the top of the stack. If the stack
   *  is already at capacity, the oldest element will be lost.
   *  @param the new element
   */
  void push(const string& elem); 

  /** Removes the top object from the stack.
   *  Throws a runtime_error if the stack is empty.
   */
  void pop();
};

<H1><A NAME="task">Your Task</A></H1>

<P>
For this assignment, you will be required to give two different
implementations for the <TT>LeakyStack</TT> interface, as described below. 
We will provide you with sample initial files for these classes.

<P>

<UL>
  <LI>
      <B><TT>LeakyStackA</TT></B> 

      <P>
      One way to implement a <TT>LeakyStack</TT> is as follows.
      Use the <tt>ArrayStack</tt> implementation essentially verbatim
      from lecture, modifying only the <tt>push</tt> method accordingly.
      In the case when pushing onto a "full" stack, use a
      loop to shift all items down one location in the array.  By doing
      this, you will lose your bottommost item while
      opening up the topmost location for the newly pushed object.

  </LI>

  <LI>
      <B><TT>LeakyStackB</TT></B> 

      <P>
      A second way to implement a <TT>LeakyStack</TT> is to use an array viewed
      in a circular manner (in a style similar to our
      <tt>ArrayQueue</tt> implementation). You can mark the "top" of the circular
      stack with an extra integer variable that is an index into your
      array.  By also keeping explicit count of the current size of
      the stack, you can effectively identify the "bottom" of the
      stack as well, when needed. With a bit of care, you can more
      efficiently handle pushes, even those involving overflow.


  </LI>
</UL>

<H2>Simplifications</H2>

<p>
To make things a bit easier for this assignment,
<ul>
  <li>
      <p>
      we have intentionally defined the LeakyStack to be a stack of
      strings rather than using a generic item type.  This means that
      you do not need to write templated code for this assignment.

  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
      our driver will not rely upon the existence of proper
      "housekeeping" methods (a copy constructor, assignment operator,
      and destructor).   So you do not need to implement them, even
      though they would be necessary for legitimate versions of these
      classes.

  </li>
</ul>


<HR>


<H1><A NAME="files">Files We Are Providing</A></H1>

<P>
All such files can be <a href="p2/index.html">downloaded here</a>.


<UL>
  <LI>
      <P>
      <TT>LeakyStack.h</TT>
      <BR>
      This file formally defines the abstract class <tt>LeakyStack</tt>.

  </LI>
  <LI>
      <P>

      <TT>LeakyStackA.h</TT>
      <BR>
      This file should be used to formally define the
      <tt>LeakyStackA</tt> class, which is the first of the two
      implementations of the <tt>LeakyStack</tt> interface.
      The initial file that we provide is not complete.  Rather it
      defines all of the public methods that you will need to
      implement, yet with stubs for most of the method bodies.   You
      will need to modify this file appropriately.

  </LI>
  <LI>
      <P>
      <TT>LeakyStackA.cpp</TT>
      <BR>
      This file should contain the implementations for most of the
      methods defined in the <tt>LeakyStackA</tt> class.
      The initial file that we provide is not complete.  Rather it
      defines so-called <em>stubs</em> for each such method.  The
      stubs are syntactically correct so that they can be compiled,
      but they are in no way semantically correct implementations of
      the desired behaviors. You
      will need to modify this file appropriately.

  </LI>
  <LI>
      <P>
      <TT>LeakyStackB.h</TT>
      <BR>
      Analog to <tt>LeakyStackA.h</tt> but to be used for the
      <em>second</em> of the two implementations as outlined in this
      assignment.

  </LI>
  <LI>
      <P>
      <TT>LeakyStackB.cpp</TT>
      <BR>
      Analog to <tt>LeakyStackA.cpp</tt> but to be used for the
      <em>second</em> of the two implementations as outlined in this
      assignment.

  </LI>
  <LI>
      <P>
      <TT>WebHistoryDriver.cpp</TT>
      <BR>
      This file provides a main driver to be used in testing your
      program.  You will not need to modify this code.
      The use of the driver is discussed in the <A href="#driver">next section</A>.
  </LI>
  <LI>
      <P>
      <TT>makefile</TT>
      <BR>
      This makefile should allow  you to rebuild your project by
      simply typing 'make' rather than invoking the compiler
      directly.

<H1><A NAME="driver">Use of the Driver</A></H1>

<P>
<tt>WebHistoryDriver</tt> is a text-based, menu-driven program for
testing your LeakyStack implementations.  The menu allows you to
call any combination of LeakyStack methods.  You may even call the
constructors for either of the two implementations anytime you want to
restart with a different capacity.

<p>The interface is fairly simple.  Typing 'A' (or 'a') creates a 
leakystackA.  'B' or 'b' creates a leakystackB.  Once your stack is 
created, you can do a series of pushes, pops, and tops (using the 
appropriate letter for input), where after a push you are expected to 
enter some data which will be added to the stack.


<P>
By default, the program takes input from the keyboard.  However the
driver has an optional feature which allows it to read input from a
file rather than from a keyboard.  The file should have the identical
characters which you would use if you were typing them yourself on the
keyboard.  This feature simply allows you to test and retest your
program on a particular input without having to retype the input each
time you want to run the program.  It is also convenient at times when
running with a debugger to have the input read from a file rather than
from the keyboard.  If the program reaches the end of the file without
exiting, then it will revert back to reading input from the keyboard
for the remainder of the program.


<P>
To use this feature, you must specify the exact filename (including
any suffix), as a single argument at runtime, using a syntax such as
<pre>
./WebHistoryDriver inputfile
</pre>

<H1>
<A name="testing">Black-Box, Unit Testing</A>
</H1>

<P>

Part of developing good software is also knowing how to perform
meaningful testing of your software.  Our hypothetical motivation for
this data structure was that it might be used in the larger context of
a web browser.  One approach to testing would be to wait until the
entire project were completed and then to test the final result.  Of
course, if the browser history were not operating properly at that
point, we would have to wonder whether the problem was due to an
errant implementation of the data structure, to an errant use of a
well-written data structure, or some other problem.  Rather than
relying on a test of the entire end product, a useful approach is to
make sure that each individual piece works in isolation.  This is
called <em>unit testing</em>.  So for this assignment, you will
develop a test plan for evaluating the correctness of the
<tt>LeakyStack</tt> implementations without actually considering the
larger application (in fact, we will not actually be writing any such
hypothetical web browser).   To perform unit testing of this data
structure, you will use the provided driver which allows you to
individually call any of the public methods supported by the data
structure.


<P> There is another issue we wish for you to consider when developing
test plans.  Often, testing is performed in close coordination with an
examination of source code.  For example, we may write some code or
view some code, and then try to test that particular chunk of code.
There is an inherent danger in relying only on such tests. In
particular, if the tests are based on the same flow of thoughts as
(errant) code, we are more likely to forget to test for a particular
combination of events that were not considered by the code.  The
practice of "black box" testing is to design a set of tests based
purely on the formal specifications for a data structure, but without
actually seeing the source code.


<P>
On this assignment, we will have you develop a black-box unit
test plan for <tt>LeakyStack</tt> implementations.  Specifically, you
must submit a plain text file named "inputfile" which will be used to
test <em>other students'</em> implementations.  The goal is to create
test input which causes as many as possible of the other students'
programs to fail in some way.
Because our execution of student tests will be automated, you must
make sure that your "inputfile" strictly adheres to the file format
which is expected by the <a href="#driver">text-based driver</a>,
<TT>WebHistoryDriver</TT>, described earlier.
Your file may use at most 100 commands.  <EM>If your input file
contains more than the prescribed number of commands, we will simply
truncate the end of the file.</EM>
In order to
make sure that your inputfile follows the proper format, we strongly
recommend that you run <u>your</u> program on <u>your</u> inputfile to
make sure it is accepted by the driver.

<P>
Here is a <a href="p1/inputfile">sample input file</a>, appropriately formatted.

<H1><A NAME="grading">Grading Standards</A></H1>

<P> The assignment is worth <em>10</em> points.  Eight points will be awarded 
based on our own evaluation of your assignment and the readme file.  One point 
will be based on how well your test input checks both your and the other 
students' implementations.

<p> The final point will be added based on an early check-in with the 
professor; you will be expected to show at least 20 lines of (new) code in by 
Friday, Sept. 30.  This may be done via email, after 
class, in normal office hours, or at a different time by appointment, but it 
must be done by the end of the day on Friday.

<H1><A NAME="modular">Hints Regarding Modular Arithmetic</A></H1>

<P>
When dealing with an array in a circular fashion, there are many
possible ways for adjusting indicies as they "wrap around" the ends of
the array.  The text chooses to use modular arithmetic (the "%"
operator in C++).   Please note that its precedence is equivalent to
multiplication and division, and therefore the expression
<nobr><tt>a+b%c+d</tt></nobr> is evaluated as
<nobr><tt>a+(b%c)+d</tt></nobr> by default.  Also, the results of
<tt>a%b</tt> is system dependent if one of the operands is negative.

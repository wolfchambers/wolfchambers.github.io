<P>
Please see the <a href="../#general">general programming webpage</a> for details about
the programming environment for this course,  guidelines for
programming style, and details on electronic submission of assignments.
</P>

<P>
The only file you will need for this assignment is the <a href="../schedule/List.h">List.h</a> file that we wrote in class.  Our <a href="../schedule/testList.cpp">testList.cpp</a> file might also be of use as a starting point for your test file.
</P>

Collaboration Policy

<p>
For this assignment, <b>you must work indivicually on your program</b>.
</p>

<p>
Please make sure you adhere to the policies on
<a href="../../#integrity">academic integrity</a> in this regard.

<H1>Overview</H1>

<P>
Similar to our last program with vectors, we will add some functionality to our list class written during lecture.</p>

<p>
Please write the following  functions described below in our Vector.h file.  (Please download List.h from the course schedule webpage and insert your functions into this class, then submit the entire Vector.h file via email by the due date.)
</P>

<H1>Functions to code</h1>

<UL>
  
  <li> void remove(T value);
  
  <p>Removes the earlist occurance of value present in the list.  
  
  </li>
  
    <li>int count(T value);
    
    <p>Count the number of occurances of value present in the list.

  </li>

  <LI> void reverse();
  
  Reverses the order of the elements in the list container.

All iterators and references to elements remain valid.  Note that this means you may NOT remove elements and readd them, since this will allocate new nodes and invalidate the pointers/iterators which already exist.  You'll have to get down and dirty with pointers for this one.
 
  </LI>

</ul>

<h1>Extra Credit</h1>

<ul>
   <li>void splice(iterator position, List& other);
   
   <p>Moves elements from list other into the current list before the specified position, effectively inserting the specified elements into the list and removing them from other.

<p>This increases _size by the size that other (initially) was, and reduces the size of other to 0 ( whenever other is not the same as *this ).

<p>The operation does not involve the construction or destruction of any element object, and it is performed in constant time. (So back to the pointers.)

</li></ul>

<h1>Testing</h1>

You are also required to write a test file, similar to our testList.cpp in class.  You our welcome to use our code from class as a starting point, but your grade will be partially based on how well you test your code.  Remember to thoroughly test all possible inputs before submitting.

<P> The assignment is worth <em>10</em> points. One point will be based on 
a checkpoint with the instructor on Nov. 1, at which time you will be 
expected to have completed at least 15 lines of code for the assignment.  
One point will be based on your testList.cpp file.  The remaining 8 points will be based on the assigned functions (including commenting, indenting, and meaningful variable names). </P>

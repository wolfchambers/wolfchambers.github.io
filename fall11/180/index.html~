<h3> Announcements: </h3>
<ul>

<li><p>Nov. 26: The program due date is extended until Monday at 
midnight, instead of Sunday at midnight.  This is due to a slight bug 
in my code.  I've had to update the <a 
href="programming/p6/BinaryTree.h">BinaryTree.h</a> file for program 6. 
(If you are curious, it was in _duplicate, where I used other._data 
when other is a pointer, rather than other->_data, as well as a few 
similar errors.)  Please make sure to redownload a NEW copy of 
BinaryTree.h, or else you will find errors in your program from the old 
file!  You can check the function _duplicate yourself to be sure that you
have the new version, where the -> notation is used.

<li><p>Nov. 21: You are allowed to redo one of your problems from the midterm.  This redo will be due on Monday, Nov. 28, at the start of class.  If you miss class today and do not get your graded midterm 2 back, please email or come see me ASAP so that I can suggest a problem for you to rework over break, since there will be no extensions on this particular extra credit opportunity.

<li><p>Nov. 21: <a href="homework/hw4.pdf">Homework 4</a> is available; it will be due on Wednesday, Nov. 30, by the start of class.  

<li><p>Nov. 16:<a href="programming/program6.html">Program 6</a> is available; it will be due Sunday, Nov. 17, by 11:59pm.  Note that there is a checkpoint on Monday, Nov. 21, and that you are welcome to work with a partner on this assignment.

<li><p>Nov. 4: The next midterm will be in class on Monday, Nov. 14, and there will be a review session the Friday before.

<li><p>Nov. 4: <a href="homework/hw3.pdf">Homework 3</a> is available; it will be due next Friday, Nov. 11, at the beginning of class.  

<li><p>Oct. 28: <a href="programming/program5.html">Program 5</a> is available; it will be due next Saturday, Nov. 5, by 11:59pm.  (Again, you must work individually on program 5.)  There will be a checkpoint due next Tuesday, Nov. 1.

<li><p>Oct. 21: <a href="programming/program4.html">Program 4</a> is available; it will be due next Thursday, Oct. 27, by 11:59pm.  (Note that you must work individually on program 4.)

<li><p>Oct. 17: Sorry for the difficulty this morning; I am back on campus now and will have office hours as usual from 2-4pm.

<li><p>Oct. 12: <a ref="programming/program3.html">Program 3</a> is available; it will be due next Wednesday, Oct. 19, by 11:59pm.  Note that you may work with a partner on this programming assignment.

<li><p>Oct. 12: No class today due to illness.  I'll post the next programming assignment and the lab for tomorrow, so please make sure to check back shortly.

<li><p>Oct. 3: There will be no class today due to illness.  Since I am out of the 
office, you may have 1 extra day to work on your programs; they will now 
be due before midnight tomorrow, Oct. 4.  I'll do my best to keep up 
with email questions.

<li><p>Sept. 26: My office hours today from 2-4pm are canceled due to a sick child; please email me with any questions or to set up another time to meet.

<li><p> Sept. 26: <a href="programming/program2.html">Program 2</a> is available; it will be due next Monday by 11:59pm.

<li><p>Sept. 19: Office hours today are changed to be from 2-3pm only.  Email me if you have additional questions or need to set up a different time.

<li><p>Sept. 12: <a href="programming/program1.html">Program 1</a> is available; it will be due next Monday, Sept. 18, by 11:59pm.  Note that you allowed to work with a partner on this assignment.

<li><p>Sept. 3: <a href="homework/hw1.pdf">Homework 1</a> is available; it will be due next Saturday, Sept. 10, by 11:59pm.

<li><p> Sept. 1: If anyone attended the help session yesterday and didn't sign the extra credit sheet, email me ASAP so I can record your name.  Please include in your email one interesting thing you learned about in the help session as a verification of your attendance.

<li><p>Aug. 31: The first lab has been posted (and don't worry, this prelab 
is fairly easy).  It can be on the "labs" portion of the website, by 
clicking on the menu above.  Note that this lab is slightly different, and 
won't use the contest format that is described under "Information about Lab 
Assignments" on the lab page; that format of lab will begin next week with 
lab 2.

<li><p> Aug. 29: <a href="http://cs.slu.edu/~goldwasser/publications/python2cpp.pdf">Here</a> is a link to the transition guide that we will be using for the first 2-3 weeks of class.

<li><p> August 24: Welcome to CS180!  Please be sure to read course policies 
carefully, and check this page daily for updates or announcements.

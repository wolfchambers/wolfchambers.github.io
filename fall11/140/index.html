record for the class.

question now.

<li><p>Oct. 10: Homework 5 will be a scratch program which you get to design.

midterms have been finished).

<li><p>Sept. 26: By popular demand, I'll have office hours tomorrow (Tuesday, Sept. 27) from 3-4pm in my office, 011 Ritter, to answer any other exam review questions.  Please note that I will not be in other than 3-4pm tomorrow, so please come by my office then if you would like to meet.

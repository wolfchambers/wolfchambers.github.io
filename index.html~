<h4>About Me</h4>

I am an assistant professor in the <a 
href="http://mathcs.slu.edu/">Department of Mathematics and Computer 
Science</a> at <a href="http://www.slu.edu">Saint Louis University</a>.  I 
teach computer science, and research problems in computational topology and 
geometry, as well as combinatorics and combinatorial algorithms.  I am also 
interested in recruitment and retention issues in computer science, 
particularly as they relate to women and minorities.

<p>

I'm married to <a href="turtle.jpg">Jeff Chambers</a>.  We have a little
girl,
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/73942029@N00/">Grace</a>, and
a guinea pig <a href="Jeff_pig.jpg">Boca</a>.
In my spare time, I read a lot of books, watch various TV shows, and drink

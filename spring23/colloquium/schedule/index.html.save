<hr> <blockquote>

<p>Here is this semester's tentative schedule; I will update 
it as the semester progresses.  All assignments will be due via the class Canvas, 
in accordance with SLU's policies.

<p> All presentations are planned for 3:10-4pm in ISE 211, 
unless indicated otherwise in the table below.  
(Occasional events may take place on zoom for virtual speakers, but these will be 
announced if so.)

Rapid growth in the number of connected wireless devices (e.g., mobile 
phones, low-power IoT devices, connected vehicles, etc.) will expand the 
scale of the next-generation wireless and mobile networks. Moreover, the 
foreseen applications like digital twins, smart homes and cities, 
connected autonomous vehicles, Industry 4.0, and agriculture precision 
will require network intelligence and new spectrum technologies to 
enable ultra-low latency and highly reliable communication in complex 5G 
and beyond wireless networks. In this talk, we will discuss how to add 
intelligence in next-generation wireless networks, including: (1) new 6G 
spectrum technology, i.e., wireless visible light networking, to 
complement well with current crowded RF networks; (2) learning-based 
networking control algorithms design to optimize the system performance; 
(3) software-defined intelligent network architecture design to enable 
fast prototyping of NextG networking testbed.

Dr. Nan Cen is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer 
Science at Missouri University of Science and Technology. She received 
her Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Northeastern 
University in 2019, under the supervision of Professor Tommaso Melodia. 
She received her M.S. in Electrical Engineering from SUNY Buffalo in 
2014. She had previously received her B.S. and M.S. in Information 
Science and Engineering from Shandong University in 2008 and 2011. Dr. 
Cenâ€™s research is focused on modeling, control, and optimization for 
next-generation intelligent wireless systems and networks, data-driven 
networking control algorithms design, software defined radios based 
testbed implementation, and Artificial Intelligent of Things. She has 
chaired N2Women workshop on WoWMoM 2022 and served TPC member for EAI 
WiCon 2022, IEEE INFOCOM Workshop WCNEE 2020 AND 2021, IEEE/ACM IWQoS 
2020, etc. Dr. Cen is a member of IEEE and ACM.

Lecture Video Analysis and Its Applications
</td>

The internet is full of educational videos. Many instructors record 
themselves explaining complex topics, and then publish these videos with 
the goal of helping students from different educational levels. Among 
these, we find a large number of videos of math-oriented lectures and 
tutorials covering topics that are better explained using handwritten 
content on whiteboards or chalkboards. In this talk, I will discuss 
methods for analyzing different aspects of such lecture videos including 
the handwritten content, the speaker actions and the temporal segments 
of the lecture. The information produced by these methods enables the 
creation of tools for advanced applications such as video summarization, 
navigation and search. In turn, these applications can help both 
students and instructors find useful educational resources when they 
need them.

Rapid growth in the number of connected wireless devices (e.g., mobile 
phones, low-power IoT devices, connected vehicles, etc.) will expand the 
scale of the next-generation wireless and mobile networks. Moreover, the 
foreseen applications like digital twins, smart homes and cities, 
connected autonomous vehicles, Industry 4.0, and agriculture precision 
will require network intelligence and new spectrum technologies to 
enable ultra-low latency and highly reliable communication in complex 5G 
and beyond wireless networks. In this talk, we will discuss how to add 
intelligence in next-generation wireless networks, including: (1) new 6G 
spectrum technology, i.e., wireless visible light networking, to 
complement well with current crowded RF networks; (2) learning-based 
networking control algorithms design to optimize the system performance; 
(3) software-defined intelligent network architecture design to enable 
fast prototyping of NextG networking testbed.

Lecture Video Analysis and Its Applications
</td>
<td>
Kenny Mauricio Davila Castellanos
</td>
<td>

The internet is full of educational videos. Many instructors record 
themselves explaining complex topics, and then publish these videos with 
the goal of helping students from different educational levels. Among 
these, we find a large number of videos of math-oriented lectures and 
tutorials covering topics that are better explained using handwritten 
content on whiteboards or chalkboards. In this talk, I will discuss 
methods for analyzing different aspects of such lecture videos including 
the handwritten content, the speaker actions and the temporal segments 
of the lecture. The information produced by these methods enables the 
creation of tools for advanced applications such as video summarization, 
navigation and search. In turn, these applications can help both 
students and instructors find useful educational resources when they 
need them.

Toward Practical Program Repair
</td>
<td>
Ali Ghanbari
</td>
<td>

Automatic program repair (APR) is one of the recent advances in automated software 
engineering aiming for reducing the burden of debugging by suggesting patches that either 
directly fix the bugs or help the programmers during manual debugging. Despite the 
remarkable progress of APR in the last decade, state-of-the-art techniques suffer from 
problems in three areas of scalability, applicability, and effective patch correctness 
assessment, reducing practicality of APR.

In this talk, I will describe the steps that we have taken toward realizing practical APR by 
proposing solutions to alleviate each of the above-mentioned problems. As for scalability 
and applicability, we introduce and evaluate Java Virtual Machine (JVM) bytecode-level patch 
generation and validation which allows (1) on-the-fly patch generation and validation and 
(2) uniform treatment of programs written in dozens of programming languages. This speed-up 
also allows our technique to explore more of repair search space and find more genuine fixes 
than state-of-the-art. We also introduce and evaluate two techniques for correctness 
assessment of automatically generated patches via both ranking and classification.

In recent years, computer vision and machine learning systems have made huge strides towards performing at or beyond human performance on a variety of visual recognition and understanding tasks -- image classification, segmentation, and generation among them. These sorts of algorithms have been deployed in tools like Google Image Search, Facebook facial detection and identification, and in self-driving cars. In this talk, we focus on the use of computer vision and machine learning tools for the social good, with an emphasis on two use cases: identifying the location of a lost grave of a young murder victim, and determining what hotels human trafficking victims are photographed in. The talk will discuss not only the specific algorithmic details behind the different applications, but also the ethical concerns of building such powerful visual tools.

The industry is filled with many “data _____” job titles, so deciphering them all can be confusing. How many ways can you realistically work with data? Are some of these actually the same? Which ones are someone with a CS degree prepared for? After this talk you should have some idea of what the different data-related roles are in the industry. We'll cover a lot of the common “data” related job roles and attempt to make some sense of it all.

APECS: A Distributed Access Control Framework for Pervasive Edge Computing Services
</td>
<td>
Reza Tourani
</td>
<td>
Edge Computing is a new computing paradigm where applications operate at the network edge, providing low-latency services with augmented user and data privacy. A desirable goal for edge computing is pervasiveness, that is, enabling any capable and authorized entity at the edge to provide desired edge services–pervasive edge computing (PEC). However, efficient access control of users receiving services and edge servers handling user data, without sacrificing performance is a challenge. Current solutions, based on “always-on” authentication servers in the cloud, negate the latency benefits of services at the edge and also do not preserve user and data privacy. In this paper, we present APECS, an advanced access control framework for PEC, which allows legitimate users to utilize any available edge services without need for communication beyond the network edge. The APECS framework leverages multi-authority attribute-based encryption to create a federated authority, which delegates the authentication and authorization tasks to semi-trusted edge servers, thus eliminating the need for an “always-on” authentication server in the cloud. Additionally, APECS prevents access to encrypted content by unauthorized edge servers. We analyze and prove the security of APECS in the Universal Composability framework and provide experimental results on the GENI testbed to demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of APECS.

Daniel Shown
</td>
<td>
Source code for software is widely available online, but many questions remain for software professionals. Why do organizations choose to release their proprietary code or collaborate with their competitors? What opportunities and obligations exist when working with open source software? How can software professionals engage in the world of open source software effectively and responsibly? Many myths have developed online and many professionals jeopardize their careers by working under false assumptions. There are a handful of critical things anyone developing software should know about working with open source software, and good resources available to help answer more complex questions.

Advanced Computational Techniques for Real-Time Biological Sequence Analyses
</td>

Ted Ahn
</td>
<td>

The exponential advances in sequencing technologies and informatics tools for generating and 
processing large biological data sets are promoting a paradigm shift in the way we approach 
in bioinformatics and biomedical problems. The vast amount of resulting sequencing data can 
help the diagnosis and precision medicine but poses a challenge: accurately characterizing a 
sample in a computationally feasible fashion, despite specimen diversity.  In this talk, I 
will describe how to solve bio- and biomedical informatics research problems using advanced 
computational techniques for aiming real-time biological sequence analyses. First, I will 
present metagenomic sequence analysis by classifying metagenomic samples using microbiota 
information and machine learning techniques to identify and predict disease samples 
precisely. Second, I will introduce immune cell sequencing analysis. Sequencing T-cell 
receptors (TCR) can provide us with a robust resource for understanding whether an 
individual has been infected with a pathogen after the infection occurred. Even after the 
infection is eliminated, pathogen-specific immune cells and their receptor sequences are 
present at higher frequencies than prior to infection, and their increase in frequency 
prevents secondary infections. We developed a scalable deep neural network model to advance 
our capabilities of identifying infections from pathogen-specific TCR sequences in 
circulation over time with exceptional sensitivity. infections from pathogen-specific TCR 
sequences in circulation over time with exceptional sensitivity.

Exploring the mathematical shape of plants
</td>
<td>
Erik J. Amézquita
</td>
<td>
Shape is foundational to biology. Observing and documenting shape has fueled biological understanding as the shape of biomolecules, cells, tissues, and organisms arise from the effects of genetics, development, and the environment. To comprehensively quantify the vast morphological diversity in plant biology, we focus thus on Topological Data Analysis (TDA). TDA is an emerging mathematical discipline that uses principles from algebraic topology to comprehensively measure shape in a broad scope of different datasets. Using a function that relates the similarity of data points to each other, we can monitor the evolution of core mathematical shape features ---connected components, loops, and voids. This evolution, a shape signature, concisely summarizes large, complex datasets. As a proof of concept, we explore three applications of TDA in plant biology based on X-ray CT scan 3D reconstructions. First, we analyze the shape of tens of thousands of barley seeds. With the Euler Characteristic Transform, topological shape descriptors of the seeds are used to successfully characterize different barley varieties based solely on the grain morphology. Understanding grain shape can allow us to select better grains for an ever-changing climate. Second, we use directional statistics and persistence homology to model the shape and distribution of citrus and their oil glands. Quantifying these distributions can allow us to understand better citrus fruit development. Finally, we comprehensively measure the shape of walnut shells and kernel to then explore how shape nuances can play significant differences in a walnut crackability and domestication. Combining traditional and topological shape descriptors, we explore the relationship between shell morphology and the force required to crack it open. The vision of TDA, that data is shape and shape is data, will be relevant as biology transitions into a data-driven era where meaningful interpretation of large datasets is a limiting factor.

Constrained Optimization of Elastic Task Adaptation in Real-Time Systems
</td>
<td>
Marion Sudvarg
</td>
<td>
Applications ranging from simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) to prompt detection of astrophysical transients are subject to exogenous timing constraints whose satisfaction may be met according to application-specific objective functions. Optimization within those constraints requires new models and analyses that can offer rigorous assurance while exploiting opportunities to improve performance. Furthermore, in resource-constrained and mixed criticality environments, dynamic application requirements and resource availability may force tasks to adapt execution state to maintain deadline guarantees. In this talk, I will discuss the design of new elastic scheduling models that provide principled and provable approaches to adaptation for recurrent real-time task systems. These frameworks can compress task utilization to maximize the expected computational and functional performance of the application within the bounds of timing constraints. Extensions to these models reduce pessimism in resource allocation, especially for parallel tasks, for which finding an optimal schedule is generally intractable. I apply and evaluate this approach in the context of the Advanced Particle-astrophysics Telescope (APT) and its Antarctic Demonstrator (ADAPT), and as future work consider other relevant applications such as ORB-SLAM.

Towards morphing geodesic graphs on the sphere
</td>
<td>
Christian Howard
</td>
<td>
Given two graph embeddings Γ_0 and Γ_1 on a surface, a well studied class of problems in computational topology revolve around the existence and construction of continuous transformations between the two embeddings that preserve the embedding property, referred to as morphs, and potentially other properties, e.g. convexity.
In this talk, we focus on a surprisingly challenging variant: morphs between geodesic spherical embeddings. With applications in areas like graphics, it is surprising that unlike many other surfaces, there has yet to be given a provably correct and sufficiently general geodesic spherical morphing algorithm that requires only a polynomial number of morphing steps. In this talk, we first discuss the simpler related variant of planar morphing and draw connections to the spherical case while also identifying the new challenges. We then discuss theoretical progress towards efficient spherical morphs and discuss some new promising directions to resolve the more general case.

Seed composition estimation from standing crops: A multitemporal, multimodal and multisensory approach to estimate soybean seed composition using machine learning
</td>
<td>
Dr. Vasit Sagan

<td>
Global food security has increasingly been strained by climate change and geopolitical strife. The increasing population requires 70% more food to feed the humanity in next several decades. With limited arable land and shrinking water resources, innovations in technologies including remote sensing, computing, AI/ML, and crop breeding become vital to improving food security while advancing agricultural sustainability.  We present how very high-resolution UAV and satellite data are used to predict crop yields and seed composition from in-season standing crops. We compare the results from satellite imaging with drone-based estimation in order to investigate the scalability of remote sensing observations. We show that advances in AI and computing coupled with remote sensing offer new insights for global food security improvements and the development of more environmentally resilient farming systems.

<h3> Announcements: </h3>
<ul>

<li><p> April 25: I've posted the final essay assignment.  It will be due by Monday, May 11 (anytime); 
please submit on our class moodle.  Keep in mind this final assignment counts towards some of the credit that 
would have been on a final exam, so please spend some time researching and writing!  I also encourage you to 
consider an appointment with the writing center, to check structure and grammar - they've moved their 
services online, and in my experience have been very helpful to students working on essays.

<li><p> April 21: Homework 9 is now posted.  Instead of two more (one due each of the following Mondays), 
I put everything on a single homework, which will be worth twice a normal HW grade.  I'd suggest 
splitting it up, though, and trying to get through the first 3-4 problems by Monday!  

<li><p> April 15: Apologies, but someone pointed out a small bug in HW8. In problem 3, for the function squash, the first input should be a function with type (a -> a -> b), and not (a -> a -> a).  I have updated the pdf to be correct, but older versions will still have the bug in them, if you downloaded it earlier.

<li><p> April 8: Homework 8 is now available; it will be due by 11:59pm on Monday, April 20 via git.

<li><p> March 27: Homework 7 is available it will be due 11:59pm on Monday, April 6 via git.

<li><p> March 27: I have posted the zoom recording from today's discussion, which mainly was about questions in Chapter 1 
and 2 of the assigned reading.  I'll keep posting these on the schedule page; they are NOT required, but you're welcome to 
listen if you were unable to join during the class time.

<li><p> March 23: Thanks for those that joined today!  It was very nice to hear some friendly voices. I do want to 
emphasize joining is not necessary, but is rather an option to get help if you need it.  In case anyone would like 
to glance at the slides I would have used to cover Haskell in person, the easiest thing is to find them on last 
year's course page: <a href="https://cs.slu.edu/~chambers/spring19/programminglanguages/index.html">CSCI spring 
2019</a>.  Again, these are not required reading!  In particular, it may come in a different order than the text, so it may be easier to just stick with the reading - up to you.

<li><p> March 21: Last (overdue) update: In addition to the homework, your first two reading assignments are due (via Perusall) 
this week.  Please access the class moodle, and following the link there to the perusall - you should get access via that link, 
and not via a separate login.  You have reading due Tuesday by midnight and Friday by midnight this week; from here on out, 
you'll have reading due every Sunday and Thursday (to space them out and allow me to answer questions via zoom on Monday and 
Friday).

<li><p> March 21: The <a href="revisedSyllabus.pdf">revised course syllabus</a> is now available.  I encourage you to read it closely, since it describes everything I plan to revise for the rest of the semester!

<li><p> March 20: As promised via email, your essay due date was extended.  I've set it to be due via the class moodle page on Wednesday, March 25, by midnight.  You just click on that assignment and upload your document; I plan to grade and give feedback directly on moodle, since I can't print anymore.

<li><p> March 4: The next homework, your longer essay assignment, is posted; it will be due on Friday, March 20.  Note that this one is longer than the first, so you may want to do a bit of reading and get started over break!  

<lI><p> Feb. 26: Due to printer issues, I'm posting an old verison of the <a href="midterm.pdf">midterm exam</a> instead of printing; please download and print your own copy this week.  (I'll delete this electronic copy as of the day of the exam.)

<li><p> Feb. 26: Homework 5 had a slight bug on question 3; I've updated and posted a new version.

<li><p> Feb. 25: The <a href="mtreview.pdf">midterm review</a> questions are now available.  

<li><p> Feb. 24: The midterm exam will be next Wednesday, March 4.  We'll have a review session in class on Monday, March 2.  (Remember that you also have a quiz due tonight, 2/24; I won't post a quiz next week since you'll be busy with homework and studying.)

<li><p> Feb. 24: Homework 5 is now posted; it will be due by the beginning of class next Monday, March 2.  No extensions, since I'll be passing out solutions at the beginning of class!

<li><p> Feb. 17: Pardon all the moodle issues!  Quiz 3 is REALLY posted now; I've extended the due date to Wednesday because visibility wasn't set correctly as promised.  Next quiz is due on Monday, 2/24 by midnight.

<li><p> Feb. 14: Slides are updated.  I'll be posting a quiz today, which will be due by Monday at midnight.

<li> <p> Feb. 12: HW 4 is now available; it will be due on Friday, Feb. 21.

<li> <p>Feb. 10: Just a reminder that the homework is due via git by midnight, unless you've requested an extension.  Course repos are all set up for 3200, and I'm getting the sense that you have all used these before, but please come see me if anything goes wrong or you need help setting up!  (I'm happy to extend until tomorrow for any git issues.)

<li><p> Jan. 29: No quiz this week, but homework 3 is available; it will be due on Monday, Feb. 10 at midnight, via git.

<li> <p> Jan. 15: The course moodle is now available!  It is at cs.slu.edu/moodle, and you should each have an account ready to go.  The first quiz will be due this Sunday, Jan. 19, by 11:59pm.  (You should be able to complete it after class today with no issues.)

<li> <p> Jan. 14: The first essay is posted on the homework page; it will be due next Wednesday, Jan. 22.

<li> <p> Welcome to programming languages!  Please make sure to read the course
policies carefully, and remember to check this announcements section
daily for new announcements or reminders.

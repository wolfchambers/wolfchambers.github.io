      <li> Homework and Programming Assignments (40%)

	<p> There will be a series of written homeworks, essay assignments 
in the class, and programming assignments which (in total) will compromise 
40% of your final score.  Essays will be over papers assigned in class.  

      </li>
    
     <li> Quizzes or in class work (10%)
     
     <p>A total of 10% of your final grade is reserved for in class exercises and online quizzes, while will be posted (on moodle or blackboard) 
and/or given in class.


	<li> Exams (50%)

	<p> There will be a midterm worth 20% of your total grade, and a 
final exam worth 30% of your total grade.  The midterm will be the week 
before spring break (unless we have any major schedule changes).

    </ul> 

    </li>

    <LI> <H3><A name="percentages">Percentages</A></H3>

      <P>
      Letter grades will be based on each students overall
      percentage of awarded points according to the following
      formula.
      </P>
      
      <DL>
	<DD>
	    Student percentage above 93% will result in a grade of

      </DL>Any modification to this scale at the end of the year
      will be <EM>in favor of the students</EM>. That is we may
      later decide to award an A to a student who is slightly
      below the above cutoff, but we certainly will not deny
      an A from someone who is above the cutoff.
  </LI>


  <li> <h3><a name="latehomework">Late Homework</a></h3>

	<p> 
 Homeworks will generally be due at 11:59pm via email.  Late 
submissions will generally not be accepted unless arrangements have been made 
ahead of time.  Please contact me as early as possible with any potential 
issues, since I am much more likely to grant an extension if you come to be 
ahead of time!  In general, I try to be flexible if students have good reason, 
but I do reserve the right to not accept late submissions if solutions have 
already been released or if a student is abusing this flexibility.

  </li>

  <li> <h3><a name="regrades">Regrade Requests</a></h3>

	<p> I am happy to regrade any assignments, programs, quizzes or exam problems which you 
think were unfair or incorrect.  Please bring me the original assignment, plus a written 
explanation of your question or complaint, within <em>two weeks</em> of the time the paper in 
question is graded and returned to you.

  </li>

  <li> <H3><A name="academicintegrity">Academic Integrity</A></H3>

<p> In the context of this course, I encourage students to discuss general
course material, which includes studying for exams, sharing notes if a
student must miss class, and working on any practice problems which are
assigned.  We will also have occasional programming assignments that will
be completed in pairs.  However, unless clearly stated otherwise in the
assignment description, any work which will be submitted for a grade must
be completed by individuals.  In addition, the <b> only </b> acceptable
sources of information are the course textbook, the instructor, official
university tutors, or other sources which are explicitly mentioned in an
assignment.  Students may <b>not</b> use other sources, including (but not
limited to) websites other than the official course website or those
explicitly listed in course materials, textbooks other than those
officially listed below, or students (either past or present). </p>

<p> Students who violate academic integrity policies will be reported to 
the department.  First time offenses on homework will result in a minimum
of a failing grade on the assignment in question, with egregious or
repeated offenses resulting in failure in the course.  In addition,
students may be referred to the College of Arts and Sciences for further
disciplinary action.

    <p>The following is a statement of minimum standards for student 
academic integrity at Saint Louis University; I expect full compliance with
the policies described.</p>

Academic integrity is honest, truthful and responsible conduct in all academic endeavors. The mission of Saint Louis University is "the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity."  Accordingly, all acts of falsehood demean and compromise the corporate endeavors of teaching, research, health care, and community service via which SLU embodies its mission. The University strives to prepare students for lives of personal and professional integrity, and therefore regards all breaches of academic integrity as matters of serious concern.
 
The governing University-level Academic Integrity Policy was adopted in Spring 2015, and can be accessed on the Provost's Office website at: https://www.slu.edu/provost/policies/academic-and-course/policy_academic-integrity_6-26-2015.pdf. 
 
Additionally, each SLU College, School, and Center has adopted its own academic integrity policies, available on their respective websites.  All SLU students are expected to know and abide by these policies, which detail definitions of violations, processes for reporting violations, sanctions, and appeals.  Please direct questions about any facet of academic integrity to your faculty, the chair of the department of your academic program, or the Dean/Director of the College, School or Center in which your program is housed.

<a name="children"><h3>Policy on Children in Class:</h3></a>

<p> For any student raising children, I understand that minor illnesses and 
unforeseen disruptions in childcare often put parents in the position of having 
to chose between missing class to stay home with a child and leaving him or her 
with someone you or the child does not feel comfortable with. While this is not 
meant to be a long-term childcare solution, occasionally bringing a child to 
class in order to cover gaps in care is perfectly acceptable.

<p> All exclusively breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as is 
necessary to support the breastfeeding relationship. Because not all women can 
pump sufficient milk, and not all babies will take a bottle reliably, I never 
want students to feel like they have to choose between feeding their baby and 
continuing their education. You and your nursing baby are welcome in class 
anytime.

<p>I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment that 
is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in parenting 
status. In all cases where babies and children come to class, I ask that you 
sit close to the door so that if your little one needs special attention and is 
disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until their need 
has been met. Non-parents in the class, please reserve seats near the door for 
your parenting classmates.

(Policy adapted from Dr. Melissa Cheyney)

<A name="title9"><h3>Title IX</h3></A>

<p>Saint Louis University and its faculty are committed to supporting our students and seeking an environment that is free of bias, discrimination, and harassment. If you have encountered any form of sexual misconduct (e.g. sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, domestic or dating violence), we encourage you to report this to the University. If you speak with a faculty member about an incident of misconduct, that faculty member must notify SLU’s Title IX coordinator, Anna R. Kratky (DuBourg Hall, room 36;akratky@slu.edu; 314-977-3886) and share the basic facts of your experience with her. The Title IX coordinator will then be available to assist you in understanding all of your options and in connecting you with all possible resources on and off campus.

<p>If you wish to speak with a confidential source, you may contact the counselors at the University Counseling Center at 314-977-TALK. To view SLU’s sexual misconduct policy and for resources, please visit the following web addresses: www.slu.edu/here4you and https://www.slu.edu/general-counsel.

<LI>
<A name="disabilities"><h3>Disability Services</h3></A>

<p>Students with a documented disability who wish to request academic accommodations must contact Disability Services to discuss accommodation requests and eligibility requirements. Once successfully registered, the student also must notify the course instructor that they wish to access accommodations in the course.

<p>Please contact Disability Services, located within the Student Success Center, at Disability_services@slu.edu or 314.977.3484 to schedule an appointment. Confidentiality will be observed in all inquiries. Once approved, information about the student’s eligibility for academic accommodations will be shared with course instructors via email from Disability Services and viewed within Banner via the instructor’s course roster.  

<p>Note: Students who do not have a documented disability but who think they may have one are encouraged to contact to Disability Services.

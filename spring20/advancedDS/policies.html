      <blockquote> 

This course is concerned with the design, analysis, and implementation of advanced data 
structures. A key element of the course will be the role of data structures in algorithm 
design, as well as the use of amortized complexity analysis to determine how data structures 
affect performance.

The precise topics will depend on the interests and background of the course participants; 
see the current schedule for details. Potential topics include self-adjusting binary 
search trees, dynamic trees and graphs, persistent data structures, geometric data 
structures, kinetic data structures, I/O-efficient and cache-oblivious data structures, hash 
tables and Bloom filters, data structures that beat information-theoretic lower bounds, and 
applications of these data structures in computational geometry, combinatorial optimization, 
systems and networking, databases, and other areas of computer science.

    <li>

	<H3><A name="lecturenotes">Lecture Notes and Additional References</A></h3>

	<p>Lecture notes will be posted on the course schedule page.  These are provided as a 
resource, but are NOT a substitute for attending lecture.  In particular, something will 
break at least once this semester!  Please make arrangements with a fellow student if you do 
have to miss class.

    <p>Additional articles or online references will be provided throughout 
the semeseter; please reference the schedule throughout the semester
      for such additions.

      <h3><a name="email">Email</a></h3>

      <p> Email contact with the course instructor is a necessity in this 
class..  I will check email several times throughout the work day, and will 
also check email once per evening to answer questions and resolve issues.  
Email contact over the weekend may be more sporadic, although I will be 
sure to check at least once.
      </p>

    </li>

<li> <h3><a name="git">Git</a></h3> <p> We will use a git system this year to submit any
coding assignments or final projects.
Details on how to sign up and use the system will be posted on the 
announcement page and discussed in class. </p> </li>


    <li> <h3><A name="computercell">Computer and Cell Phone Policy</a></h3>

    <p> Computers will be an integral part of this course, both inside and
      outside of class.  However, out of courtesy to both the instructor and
      other students, please do not use the lab computers for non-class
      related activity.  In particular, you do not need to be using a computer
      unless an exercise or in class activity requiring them is in progress.
      </p>

    <p> You are unlikely to need cell phones during the course of lecture.  
Please ensure that your cell phone is set to vibrate or silent during 
lecture, and excuse yourself from class if you need to answer it.  </p>

      <li> Homework and/or Programming Assignments 

	<p> There will be a series of written/or and programming assignments which (in total) 
will compromise half of your final grade.

  <li> <h3><a name="latehomework">Late Homework</a></h3>

	<p> 
 Homeworks will generally be due at 11:59pm via email.  Late 
submissions will generally not be accepted unless arrangements have been made 
ahead of time.  Please contact me as early as possible with any potential 
issues, since I am much more likely to grant an extension if you come to be 
ahead of time!  In general, I try to be flexible if students have good reason, 
but I do reserve the right to not accept late submissions if solutions have 
already been released or if a student is abusing this flexibility.

  </li>

  <li> <h3><a name="regrades">Regrade Requests</a></h3>

	<p> I am happy to regrade any assignments, programs, quizzes or exam problems which you 
think were unfair or incorrect.  Please bring me the original assignment, plus a written 
explanation of your question or complaint, within <em>two weeks</em> of the time the paper in 
question is graded and returned to you.

  </li>

  <li> <H3><A name="academicintegrity">Academic Integrity</A></H3>

<p>In the context of this course, I encourage students to discuss general course material, which includes studying for exams, sharing notes if a student 
must miss class, and working on any practice problems which are assigned. You are also allowed to turn in homework assignments in pairs. I also 
encourage you to discuss problems with other students, but please be careful to write up all solutions separately in your own group, and do not copy 
any material from another student. As a good rule of thumb, make sure to write your solutions without using any notes or papers written while talking 
to anyone other than your partner. Remember, you will be on your own in the exam, so it is in your own best interest to make sure that you really 
understand the material and can solve each problem on your own!

<p>You are allowed to use outside sources of information in this class, including textbooks and webpages. If the complete and correct answer is on 
page 10 of the lecture notes from class, the best solution you can submit is "See page 10 of lecture notes on this date." Period. However, if you find 
a solution from any other source, such as a web page, a journal paper, a different algorithms textbook, or your mom, you must rewrite the solution in 
your own words, and you must properly cite your sources. Assume the graders have access to all the official course material, but nothing else. While 
we strongly encourge you to use any outside source at your disposal, please remember that the homework is supposed to demonstrate that you understand 
of the material, not just how to use Google. In particular, verbatim copying is worth NOTHING, and will be considered a violation of the academic 
integrity policy. (Note that I'm also pretty good with google, so I wouldn't recommend trying it!)

<p>Students who violate academic integrity policies will be reported to the department, particularly in cases where relevant sources are not cited or in 
cases of direct copying of another student's work. First time offenses on homework will result in a minimum of a failing grade on the assignment in 
question, with egregious or repeated offenses resulting in failure in the course. In addition, students may be referred to the College of Arts and 
Sciences for further disciplinary action.

    <p>The following is a statement of minimum standards for student 
academic integrity at Saint Louis University; I expect full compliance with
the policies described.</p>

Academic integrity is honest, truthful and responsible conduct in all academic endeavors. The mission of Saint Louis University is "the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity."  Accordingly, all acts of falsehood demean and compromise the corporate endeavors of teaching, research, health care, and community service via which SLU embodies its mission. The University strives to prepare students for lives of personal and professional integrity, and therefore regards all breaches of academic integrity as matters of serious concern.
 
The governing University-level Academic Integrity Policy was adopted in Spring 2015, and can be accessed on the Provost's Office website at: https://www.slu.edu/provost/policies/academic-and-course/policy_academic-integrity_6-26-2015.pdf. 
 
Additionally, each SLU College, School, and Center has adopted its own academic integrity policies, available on their respective websites.  All SLU students are expected to know and abide by these policies, which detail definitions of violations, processes for reporting violations, sanctions, and appeals.  Please direct questions about any facet of academic integrity to your faculty, the chair of the department of your academic program, or the Dean/Director of the College, School or Center in which your program is housed.

<a name="children"><h3>Policy on Children in Class:</h3></a>

<p> For any student raising children, I understand that minor illnesses and 
unforeseen disruptions in childcare often put parents in the position of having 
to chose between missing class to stay home with a child and leaving him or her 
with someone you or the child does not feel comfortable with. While this is not 
meant to be a long-term childcare solution, occasionally bringing a child to 
class in order to cover gaps in care is perfectly acceptable.

<p> All exclusively breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as is 
necessary to support the breastfeeding relationship. Because not all women can 
pump sufficient milk, and not all babies will take a bottle reliably, I never 
want students to feel like they have to choose between feeding their baby and 
continuing their education. You and your nursing baby are welcome in class 
anytime.

<p>I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment that 
is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in parenting 
status. In all cases where babies and children come to class, I ask that you 
sit close to the door so that if your little one needs special attention and is 
disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until their need 
has been met. Non-parents in the class, please reserve seats near the door for 
your parenting classmates.

(Policy adapted from Dr. Melissa Cheyney)

<A name="title9"><h3>Title IX</h3></A>

<p>Saint Louis University and its faculty are committed to supporting our students and seeking an environment that is free of bias, discrimination, and harassment. If you have encountered any form of sexual misconduct (e.g. sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, domestic or dating violence), we encourage you to report this to the University. If you speak with a faculty member about an incident of misconduct, that faculty member must notify SLU’s Title IX coordinator, Anna R. Kratky (DuBourg Hall, room 36;akratky@slu.edu; 314-977-3886) and share the basic facts of your experience with her. The Title IX coordinator will then be available to assist you in understanding all of your options and in connecting you with all possible resources on and off campus.

<p>If you wish to speak with a confidential source, you may contact the counselors at the University Counseling Center at 314-977-TALK. To view SLU’s sexual misconduct policy and for resources, please visit the following web addresses: www.slu.edu/here4you and https://www.slu.edu/general-counsel.
